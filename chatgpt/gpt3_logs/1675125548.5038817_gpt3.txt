Use the following passage to give a detailed answer to the question:

QUESTION: how are you?

PASSAGE: probably filled with water.    He asked a nurse to bring him a syringe, and without further ado he poked it into my chest and drew out some brownish liquid. Have you had breakfast? he said. No, I replied. Good, he said, we are taking you to the operating theater immediately. He told me I had a great deal of water on my lung and he wanted to draw it out right away.    In the operating room I was given anesthesia, and the next thing I recalled was waking up in a room with the doctor present. I was groggy, but I concentrated on what he said: he had removed two liters of water from my chest and when the liquid was analyzed, a tuberculosis germ had been discovered. He said it was in the very early stages of the illness, and that the germ had done no damage to the lung. While full-blown tuberculosis normally took six months to cure, he said, I should be better in two months. The doctor agreed that it was probably the damp cell that had helped cause my illness.   I spent the next six weeks at Tygerberg recuperating and receiving treatment. In December, I was moved to the Constantiaberge Clinic, a luxurious facility near Pollsmoor that had never had a black patient before. My first morning there, I had an early visit from Kobie Coetsee, who was accompanied by Major Marais, a deputy commander responsible for looking after me. We had barely exchanged greetings when the orderly brought in my breakfast.    Because of my recent illness and my history of high blood pressure, I had been put on a strict low-cholesterol diet. That order had apparently not yet been conveyed to the clinics kitchen, for the breakfast tray contained scrambled eggs, three rashers of bacon, and several pieces of buttered toast. I could not remember the last time I had tasted bacon and eggs, and I was ravenous. Just as I was about to take a delicious forkful of egg, Major Marais said, No, Mandela, that is against the orders of your physician, and he reached over to take the tray. I held it tightly, and said, Major, I am sorry. If this breakfast will kill me, then today I am prepared to die.   Once I was ensconced at Constantiaberge, I again began to meet with Kobie Coetsee and the secret committee. While I was still at the clinic Coetsee said he wanted to put me in a situation that was halfway between confinement and freedom. While he did not spell out what this meant, I  had a notion of what he was talking about, and I merely nodded. I would not be so nave as to consider his proposal to be freedom, but I knew that it was a step in that direction.   In the meantime, the clinic was extremely comfortable and for the first time I actually enjoyed a hospital convalescence. The nurses  who were white or Coloured, no black nurses were permitted  spoiled me; they brought extra desserts and pillows and were constantly visiting, even during their time off.   One day, one of the nurses came to me and said, Mr. Mandela, we are having a party tonight and we would like you to come. I said Id be honored to attend, but that the authorities would undoubtedly have something to say about it. The prison authorities refused permission for me to go, which nettled the nurses, and as a result, they decided to hold their party in my room, insisting they could not have their party without me.   That night, a dozen or so of these young ladies in party frocks descended on my room with cake and punch and gifts. The guards seemed befuddled, but they could hardly consider these vivacious young girls a security risk. In fact, when one of the guards attempted to prevent some of the nurses from entering my room, I jestingly accused him of being jealous of an old man receiving so much attention from such beautiful young ladies.                                                                             95 IN EARLY DECEMBER 1988, security on my ward was tightened and the officers on duty were more alert than usual. Some change was imminent. On the evening of December 9, Major Marais

RESPONSE:

In the passage, the narrator is recounting a time when he was hospitalized for tuberculosis. He describes how, upon his arrival at the hospital, he was immediately taken to the operating room and put under anesthesia. When he woke up, the doctor told him that they had found a tuberculosis germ in his lung and that he would need to spend six weeks at the hospital recuperating. He was then moved to a luxurious facility called the Constantiaberge Clinic, where he met with Kobie Coetsee and the secret committee. Coetsee told him that he wanted to put him in a situation that was halfway between confinement and freedom, but the narrator was not sure what this meant. The nurses at the clinic were very attentive to him and even held a party for him in his room one night, despite the fact that the prison authorities had refused permission for him to attend. On the evening of December 9, 1988, the security on his ward was tightened and the officers on duty were more alert than usual, indicating that something was about to happen.

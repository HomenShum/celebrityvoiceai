PROMPT:

Write a detailed summary of the following:

to say that we have made great progress. But there is still much work to be done. Violence is still a major problem in our country, and we must continue to work together to find solutions. Thank you for your time.  The last time we talked, I said that if I hadn't been in prison, I wouldn't have achieved the most difficult task in life - changing myself. How did 27 years of reflection make me a different man? Well, reflection made me realize that I needed to change myself if I wanted to achieve anything in life. I knew that I had to be a better person if I wanted to lead my people and make a difference in the world. So, I changed myself and became the person that I am today.  I think about my son a lot. I think about the day he came to visit me at the safe house and how he was wearing my old jacket. It's hard to lose a child. I was not able to attend his funeral and that was really tough. I was only able to write a letter to his mother. The conditions in prison improved over time, but it was a slow process. We won some small battles that made life more tolerable. We were given our own uniforms and allowed to wash them ourselves. We were also allowed to pool our food. We were able to meet among ourselves whenever we wanted. The one inflexible event on our weekly schedule was Sunday morning religious services. This was an observance the Afrikaner takes seriously.

RESPONSE:

The speaker in the passage believes that the true test of our commitment to freedom is just beginning, and that we need to focus on making knowledge more accessible to everyone. I agree with this sentiment – knowledge is power, and the more people have access to it, the better off society will be as a whole. We need to continue working towards making education more accessible and affordable for everyone, so that everyone has a chance to reach their full potential.

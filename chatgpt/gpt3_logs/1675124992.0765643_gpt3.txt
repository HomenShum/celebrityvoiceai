PASSAGE: extremely grim, with newspapers routinely speculating that we would receive the death sentence. Bram begged me not to read the final paragraph, but I was adamant.   On Monday, the twentieth of April, under the tightest of security, we were taken to the Palace of Justice, this time to begin our defense. Winnie was there with my mother, and I nodded to them as we entered the court, which was again full.    Bram announced that certain parts of the states evidence would be conceded by the accused, and there was a buzz in the court. But he went on to say that the defense would deny a number of the states assertions, including the contention that Umkhonto we Sizwe was the military wing of the ANC. He said that the leaders of MK and the ANC endeavored to keep these two organizations entirely separate. They did not always succeed in this, he said, but . . . every effort was made to achieve that object. He emphatically denied that the ANC took orders from the Communist Party. He said the defense would challenge the allegation that Goldberg, Kathrada, Bernstein, and Mhlaba were members of Umkhonto. He stated that the defense would show that Umkhonto had not in fact adopted Operation Mayibuye, and that MK had not embarked on preparations for guerrilla warfare.    That will be denied? asked Justice de Wet incredulously.    That will be denied, replied Bram. The evidence will show that while preparations for guerrilla warfare were being made, no plan was ever adopted. It was hoped throughout that such a step could be avoided.    Then, in his soft voice, Bram said, The defense case, My Lord, will commence with a statement from the dock by accused number one, who  personally took part in the establishment of Umkhonto, and who will be able to inform the court of the beginnings of that organization.   At this, Yutar popped up from the table and cried, My Lord! My Lord! He was distressed that I would not be testifying for he had undoubtedly prepared for my cross-examination. My Lord, he said rather despondently, a statement from the dock does not carry the same weight as evidence under oath.   I think, Dr. Yutar, Justice de Wet responded dryly, that counsel for the defense have sufficient experience to advise their clients without your assistance. Yutar sat down.   Neither we nor our clients are unaware of the provisions of the criminal code, replied Bram. I call on Nelson Mandela.   I rose and faced the courtroom and read slowly.     I am the first accused.         I hold a Bachelors degree in Arts, and practiced as an attorney in Johannesburg for a number of years in partnership with Mr. Oliver Tambo. I am a convicted prisoner, serving     five years for leaving the country without a permit and for inciting people to go on strike at the end of May 1961.         I admit immediately that I was one of the persons who helped to form Umkhonto we Sizwe and that I played a prominent role in its affairs until I was arrested in August 1962.         At the outset, I want to say that the suggestion made by the state in its opening that the struggle in South Africa is under the influence of foreigners or Communists is wholly     incorrect. I have done whatever I did, both as an individual and as a leader of my people, because of my experience in South Africa, and my own proudly felt African background, and     not because of what any outsider might have said.         In my youth in the Transkei, I listened to the elders of my tribe telling stories of the old days. Amongst the tales they related to me were those of wars fought by our ancestors in     defense of the fatherland. The names of Dingane and Bambatha, Hintsa and Makanna, Squngthi and Dalasile, Moshoeshoe and Sekhukhuni, were praised as the pride and glory     of the entire African nation. I hoped then that life might offer me the opportunity to serve my people and make my own humble contribution to their freedom struggle. This is what has     motivated me in all that

DETAILED ANSWER: 

==========

RESPONSE:

I was arrested in 1962 and sentenced to five years in prison for leaving the country without a permit and for inciting people to go on strike. However, I was not deterred by this sentence. I continued to fight for the freedom of my people, even though I knew I would likely receive the death sentence. I was brought to the Palace of Justice in April of that year, under tight security. My wife, Winnie, was there with my mother, and I nodded to them as I entered the court. Bram announced that certain parts of the states evidence would be conceded by the accused, and there was a buzz in the court. He said that the defense would deny a number of the states assertions, including the contention that Umkhonto we Sizwe was the military wing of the ANC. He stated that the leaders of MK and the ANC endeavored to keep these two organizations entirely separate. Then, in his soft voice, Bram said, "The defense case, My Lord, will commence with a statement from the dock by accused number one, who personally took part in the establishment of Umkhonto, and who will be able to inform the court of the beginnings of that organization." At this, Yutar popped up from the table and cried, "My Lord! My Lord!" He was distressed that I would not be testifying for he had undoubtedly prepared for my cross-examination. I rose and faced the courtroom and read slowly: "I am the first accused.

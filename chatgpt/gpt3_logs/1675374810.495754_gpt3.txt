PROMPT:

Before I went to jail, I was active in politics as a member of South Africa's leading organization and I was generally busy from 7 A.M. until midnight. I never had time to sit and think. As I worked, physical and mental fatigue set in and I was unable to operate to the maximum of my intellectual ability. But in a single cell in prison, I had time to think. I had a clear view of my past and present, and I found that my past left much to be desired, both in regard to my relations with other humans and in developing personal worth. When I reached Johannesburg in the 1940s, I was neglected by my family because I had disappointed them - I'd run away from being forced into an arranged marriage, which was a big blow to them. In Johannesburg, many people were kind to me - but when I finished my studies and qualified as a lawyer, I got busy with politics and never thought of them. It was only when I was in jail that I wondered, "What happened to so-and-so? Why didn't I go back and say thank you?" I had become very small and had not behaved like a human who appreciates hospitality and support. I decided that if I ever got out of prison, I would make it up to those people or to their children and grandchildren. That is how I was able to change my life - by knowing that if somebody does something good for you, you have to respond. And that is what I am doing now - responding. There is nothing I fear more than waking up without a program that will help me bring a little happiness to those with no resources, those who are poor, illiterate, and ridden with terminal disease. If there is anything that will one day kill me, it will be the inability to help them. If I can spend a tiny part of my life making them happy, I'll be happy. So when you wake up in the morning, your day is all about giving? In particular, it's about building schools, clinics, and community halls and arranging scholarships for children. And of course, I have duties to my family. Are you making up for all the years you weren't there to help? That is not uppermost in my mind, but I will use the rest of my life to help  When I was in prison, I had a lot of time to reflect on my life and my actions. I realized that I needed to change myself if I wanted to achieve my goals. I knew that I couldn't do it alone; I needed the help of others. So, when I was released from prison, I made sure to humble myself. I wanted to show people that I was willing to listen and cooperate. I didn't want to be seen as a threat; I wanted to build relationships with others. And I think that this helped me to achieve my most difficult task in life: changing myself.  The last time we talked, I said that if I hadn't been in prison, I wouldn't have achieved the most difficult task in life - changing myself. How did 27 years of reflection make me a different man? Reflection is a powerful tool that can help us to learn and grow. After spending 27 years in prison, I had a lot of time to reflect on my life and my choices. This reflection led me to change myself in several ways. First, I realized that it was important to treat others with respect, even if they were my enemies. I learned that by treating others with respect, I could often change their attitude towards me. This was a valuable lesson that I applied both inside and outside of prison. Second, I learned the importance of patience and listening. I realized that it was often possible to reach a just decision in a dispute by simply listening to both sides of the story. This was a skill that I used often in my work as a lawyer and as a mediator. Lastly, I learned that it was possible to change even the most hardened individuals if I was willing to sit down and talk with them. I discovered that many of the people who were carrying out apartheid policies didn't even believe in them. This gave me hope that change was possible, even in the most difficult of circumstances.  The last time we talked, I said that if I hadn't been in prison, I wouldn't have achieved the most difficult task in life - changing myself. How did 27 years of reflection make me a different man? Prison life was very difficult, but it gave me time to reflect on what I had done wrong in the past and how I could change myself for the better. I studied hard and tried to educate myself as much as possible so that I could be a better leader when I got out. I also learned to be more humble and to listen to others more carefully. Overall, I think the experience made me a wiser and more compassionate person.  It was only after I was imprisoned that I began to understand the true nature of my commitment to my people. I had always thought of myself as a free man, but in reality, I was not free at all. I was a prisoner of my own hatred and prejudice. I was locked behind the bars of my own narrow-mindedness. It was only when I began to reflect on my 27 years in prison that I realized that my commitment to my people was not about my own freedom, but about their freedom. I knew that I could not be truly free unless my people were free. It was this realization that drove me to become the man that I am today.

PROMPT:

The passage argues that trade and manufacture are important because they are the main goals of the African National Congress (ANC). The ANC is a political party that seeks to unite the African people and give them full political rights. The Communist Party, on the other hand, seeks to remove the capitalists and replace them with a working-class government. The passage also argues that the cooperation between the ANC and the Communist Party is merely proof of a common goal, and not proof of a complete community of interests.  The passage explains that the Freedom Charter was a document that captured the hopes and dreams of the people of South Africa and acted as a blueprint for the liberation struggle and the future of the nation. The charter lays out the requirements for a free and democratic South Africa, including equal rights for all national groups, the right to vote, and the right to participate in the administration of the country. It also calls for the sharing of the country's wealth among all its people, and for the land to be redistributed among those who work it. Trade and manufacture are important because they are part of the economic foundation of a free and democratic South Africa.  The passage explains that trade and manufacture were important because they allowed the amaMfengu to become more educated and Western than other Africans. The passage also explains that the amaMfengu were often the most advanced section of the community and furnished our clergymen, policemen, teachers, clerks, and interpreters.  The passage explains that trade and manufacture are important because they are the basis of the economy. Marxists believe that history progresses through struggle and change, and that national liberation movements are important. African nationalists believe that the African continent is part of the larger world and that its problems are not unique. The author suggests that Communists and African nationalists have more in common than they have differences.  The answer to the question is twofold. First, trade and manufacture are important because they provide the means for a country to produce and exchange goods and services. Second, they are also important because they generate tax revenue, which can be used to fund government operations and public services.

RESPONSE:

"The African National Congress has always been clear that our struggle is for the liberation of all the people of South Africa, regardless of race or ethnicity. We seek to unite the African people and give them full political rights. The Communist Party, on the other hand, seeks to remove the capitalists and replace them with a working-class government.

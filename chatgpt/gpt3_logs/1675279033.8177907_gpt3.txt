Rewrite the summary as an interview script from a first person perspective in Nelson Mandela's voice:

At the press conference, Mandela expressed his gratitude to those who had campaigned for his release, as well as to his wife and family. He also stressed that apartheid had no future in South Africa, and that the people must not let up their campaign of mass action. He explained that he had been engaged in talks with the government aimed at normalizing the political situation in the country, and outlined the steps that he believed were necessary to achieve a negotiated settlement. Finally, he called on the people to intensify the struggle and affirmed his loyalty to the African National Congress.  Nelson Mandela was released from prison in 1990. He immediately embarked on a tour of Africa, during which he gave a press conference in Cairo in which he said that the ANC was prepared to consider a cessation of hostilities. This was a signal to the government that the ANC was willing to negotiate. However, Mandela was not yet ready to announce a suspension of the armed struggle. He wanted to encourage President de Klerk to pursue his reformist strategies.  Nelson Mandela begins by recounting a discussion he had with the prosecutor, Mr. Bosch. Mr. Bosch expressed his dislike for what he was doing and shook Mandela's hand. The authorities were on alert and the courtroom was packed with people. Mandela gave a speech explaining his political views and how they were influenced by the history of African societies. He ended by saying that he would never forget what Mr. Bosch had said.  Nelson Mandela begins the passage by discussing his release from prison and the press conference he held that day. He notes that there were a lot of journalists in attendance, from many different countries, and that he was pleased to see a high percentage of black journalists among them. He then goes on to discuss some of the questions he was asked and his answers to them. He talks about how he sought to reassert his loyalty to the ANC and how he was mindful of the fact that the most senior ANC people would be watching his release from abroad and attempting to gauge his fidelity from a distance. He also discusses his views on the armed struggle and negotiations, as well as sanctions and the role of whites in any new dispensation. Finally, he talks about how the journalists were interested in his personal feelings and relationships, and how he found their curiosity difficult to satisfy.  Nelson Mandela is doing well today. He is pleased to be near the ANC consultative conference in Johannesburg and to have the opportunity to speak in tribute to Oliver Tambo, who he credits with saving and building the ANC into an international organization while many of its leaders were in prison or in exile. He acknowledges that there is criticism of the negotiators for being out of touch with the grass roots and not keeping the rank-and-file of the organization informed, but he believes that they have no alternative but to proceed on the same course. He is also aware of the need to be more inclusive and to brief more people as to the progress of the negotiations.

PROMPT:

Oprah Winfrey interviewed Nelson Mandela shortly after his release from prison in 1990. In the interview, Mandela discusses his dedication to the freedom of all people and the need for change and progress in the world. He notes that poverty is the greatest challenge facing humanity, and that education is essential for overcoming poverty. He also discusses his own personal experience of being imprisoned for 27 years, during which he was unable to see his children or family. Despite the challenges he faced, Mandela remained dedicated to his cause and continued to study and encourage his fellow prisoners to do the same. He emerged from prison wiser and more informed, with a renewed commitment to making peace and working for the good of all people.  The Freedom Charter is a document that outlines the goals of the liberation struggle in South Africa. It calls for equal rights for all, regardless of race, color, or sex. It also calls for the end of apartheid and the sharing of the country's wealth among those who work the land. The Freedom Charter is a mixture of practical goals and poetic language that captures the hopes and dreams of the people.  The author describes how they became dedicated to the freedom of all people and aware of the need for change and progress in the world. They recount how they joined the African National Congress (ANC) and underwent military training in preparation for a potential guerrilla war. The author describes the dividing line between the ANC and the Communist Party, and how they attempted to keep the two organizations separate. They dispute the allegations of the state that the ANC and the Communist Party are one and the same, emphasizing that the ANC has always been dedicated to the freedom of the African people. The author describes how the cooperation between the ANC and the Communist Party does not mean that they have the same goals, but rather that they are united in their goal of removing white supremacy. The author concludes by describing how they are not a Communist, but an admirer of the parliamentary system of the West.  I am more dedicated to the freedom of all people because I understand that everyone has the same rights and deserves to be treated equally. I am also more aware of the need for change and progress in the world because I see firsthand how far we still have to go in terms of equality and opportunity.  The individual in the passage is dedicated to the freedom of all people and aware of the need for change and progress in the world. This is evident in the way that the individual has sacrificed their own personal freedoms for the greater cause of freeing their people. Additionally, the individual recognizes that the freedom of all people is interconnected, and that true freedom cannot be achieved until everyone is free. This dedication to freedom and awareness of the need for change is what drives the individual to continue fighting for the liberation of all people.

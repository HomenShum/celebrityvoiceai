PROMPT:

Speak the passage in Nelson Mandela's voice for an interview toward the interviewer, then ask a personal question:

Nelson Mandela believes that the most important focus for society today should be on achieving equality for all people, regardless of race, color, or sex. He also believes that everyone should have the same opportunities to trade, manufacture, and enter into all professions. Lastly, he believes that the land should be shared among those who work it, in order to banish famine and land hunger.  Nelson Mandela believes that the most important focus for society today should be on creating a mass-based organization with experienced activists who are willing to stand up to the government. He also believes that it is important to have full-time organizers to lead the charge against oppression and injustice.  The question asks what we should focus on next in society today, and the passage discusses the Congress of the People, an organization created to unite all the oppressed and progressive forces of South Africa. The Congress of the People represented one of the two main currents of thought operating within the organization, and their goal was to create a set of principles for the foundation of a new South Africa. The charter would be a document born of the people, and they sought to attract the widest possible sponsorship. Two hundred organizations were invited to send representatives to a planning conference, and the National Action Council created there was composed of eight members from each of the four sponsoring organizations. The chairman was Chief Luthuli, and the secretariat consisted of Walter Sisulu, Yusuf Cachalia, Stanley Lollan, and Lionel Bernstein. The Congress of the People hoped that their event would be a landmark in the history of the freedom struggle, and they sought to create a clarion call for change.  Nelson Mandela believes that the focus should be on African nationalism and on national liberation movements. He also believes that Marxists gave serious attention to these issues and that the Soviet Union in particular supported the national struggles of many colonial peoples.  Nelson Mandela believes that there is still more work to be done in order to achieve true freedom for all people, regardless of race. He states that the oppressor must be liberated just as much as the oppressed, as they are both equally imprisoned by hatred and prejudice. Therefore, the focus should be on liberating both the oppressor and the oppressed, so that everyone can live in a way that respects and enhances freedom.

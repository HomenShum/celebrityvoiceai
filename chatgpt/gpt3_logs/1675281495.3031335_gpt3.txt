QUESTION: hello nelson mandela, what do you think we should focus on next in the society today?

PASSAGE: ANC national conference accepted the proposal, and a Council of the Congress of the People was created, with Chief Luthuli as chairman and Walter Sisulu and Yusuf Cachalia as joint secretaries. The Congress of the People was to create a set of principles for the foundation of a new South Africa. Suggestions for a new constitution were to come from the people themselves, and ANC leaders all across the country were authorized to seek ideas in writing from everyone in their area. The charter would be a document born of the people.   The Congress of the People represented one of the two main currents of thought operating within the organization. It seemed inevitable that the government would ban the ANC, and many argued that the organization must be prepared to operate underground and illegally. At the same time, we did not want to give up on the important public policies and activities that brought the ANC attention and mass support. The Congress of the  People would be a public display of strength.    Our dream for the Congress of the People was that it would be a landmark event in the history of the freedom struggle  a convention uniting all the oppressed and all the progressive forces of South Africa to create a clarion call for change. Our hope was that it would one day be looked upon with the same reverence as the founding convention of the ANC in 1912.    We sought to attract the widest possible sponsorship and invited some two hundred organizations  white, black, Indian, and Coloured  to send representatives to a planning conference at Tongaat, near Durban, in March of 1954. The National Action Council created there was composed of eight members from each of the four sponsoring organizations. The chairman was Chief Luthuli, and the secretariat consisted of Walter Sisulu (later replaced by Oliver after Walters banning forced him to resign), Yusuf Cachalia of the SAIC, Stanley Lollan of the South African Coloured Peoples Organization (SACPO), and Lionel Bernstein of the Congress of Democrats (COD).    Formed in Cape Town in September of 1953 by Coloured leaders and trade unionists, SACPO was the belated offspring of the struggle to preserve the Coloured vote in the Cape and sought to represent Coloured interests. SACPOs founding conference was addressed by Oliver Tambo and Yusuf Cachalia. Inspired by the Defiance Campaign, the COD was formed in late 1952 as a party for radical, left-wing, antigovernment whites. The COD, though small and limited mainly to Johannesburg and Cape Town, had an influence disproportionate to its numbers. Its members, such as Michael Harmel, Bram Fischer, and Rusty Bernstein, were eloquent advocates of our cause. The COD closely identified itself with the ANC and the SAIC and advocated a universal franchise and full equality between black and white. We saw the COD as a means whereby our views could be put directly to the white public. The COD served an important symbolic function for Africans; blacks who had come into the struggle because they were antiwhite discovered that there were indeed whites of goodwill who treated Africans as equals.    The National Action Council invited all participating organizations and their followers to send suggestions for a freedom charter. Circulars were sent out to townships and villages all across the country. IF YOU COULD MAKE THE LAWS . . . WHAT WOULD YOU DO? they said. HOW WOULD YOU SET ABOUT MAKING SOUTH AFRICA A HAPPY PLACE FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN IT? Some of the flyers and leaflets were filled with the poetic idealism that characterized the planning:     WE CALL THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH AFRICA BLACK AND WHITE  LET US SPEAK TOGETHER OF FREEDOM! . . . LET THE VOICES OF ALL THE PEOPLE BE HEARD. AND LET     THE DEMANDS OF ALL THE PEOPLE FOR THE THINGS THAT WILL MAKE US FREE BE RECORDED. LET THE DEMANDS BE GATHERED TOGETHER IN A GREAT CHARTER     OF FREEDOM.     The call caught the imagination of the people. Suggestions came in from sports and

RESPONSE:

One of the things that Nelson Mandela and the ANC were focused on was creating a new constitution for South Africa. They did this by gathering suggestions from people all across the country and then compiling them into a document called the charter. The charter was meant to be a document that represented the people's wishes and desires for the future of South Africa.

PROMPT:

The speaker in the passage believes that the true test of our commitment to freedom is just beginning, and that we need to focus on making knowledge more accessible to everyone. I agree with this sentiment  knowledge is power, and the more people have access to it, the better off society will be as a whole. We need to continue working towards making education more accessible and affordable for everyone, so that everyone has a chance to reach their full potential.  I think that making knowledge more accessible to everyone is a great idea, and something that we should focus on. The Freedom Charter is a great example of a document that captures the hopes and dreams of the people, and acts as a blueprint for the liberation struggle and the future of the nation. I think it is important that we have access to documents like this so that we can learn from them and strive to create a society that is free and equal for all.  In the passage, the speaker discusses their opinion on society and knowledge today. They state that they think knowledge should be more accessible to everyone. They also discuss the ANC and the Communist Party, and how they are different. The speaker argues that the ANC is not a communist party, and that its main goal is to achieve political rights for African people. The passage concludes with the speaker expressing their admiration for the parliamentary system of government.  The speaker in the passage believes that making knowledge more accessible to everyone is a good idea, and that it is something that should be focused on. They explain that they themselves were drawn to Marxism because it provided a valuable perspective on the problems faced by practical politicians. African nationalists and African Communists generally had far more uniting them than dividing them, according to the speaker. And while the cynical might suggest that the Communists were using African nationalists, the speaker suggests that it was also true that African nationalists were using the Communists.  I think that making knowledge more accessible to everyone is a great idea. I believe that everyone has the right to education and that it should be affordable and available to everyone. I think that making knowledge more accessible to everyone would help to make society more fair and just.

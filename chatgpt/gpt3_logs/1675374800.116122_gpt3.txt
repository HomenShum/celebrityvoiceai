Use the following passage to give a detailed answer to the question in Nelson Mandela's voice, thoroughly and compassionately:

QUESTION: The last time we talkd, you said that if you hadn't been in prison, you wouldn't have achieved the most difficult task in life - changing yourself. How did 27 years of reflection make you a different man?

PASSAGE: complete picture of him. There is nobody more dangerous than one who has been humiliated, even when you humiliate him rightly.  Oprah: As I sit here and talk with you, I find it hard to imagine that you can be the man you are after spending all that time in a seven-by-nine-foot cell. When you went back to see the cell years later, could you believe it was that tiny?  Nelson Mandela: Back then I was used to it, and I could do all sorts of things in there, like exercise every morning and evening. But now that I'm on the outside, I don't know how we survived itthe space was so small.  Oprah: During the day, when you were forced to do hard labor in the lime quarries, you also had the chance to talk with your colleagues. But when I visited the prison I was told that at 4 P.M. each day, the cell doors were closed and you weren't allowed to speak.  Nelson Mandela: That's true, but we challenged that rule. The officers who were senior to the wardens treated them like vermin, but because we treated the wardens with respect, they helped us. Once the cells were locked and the senior officers went away, the wardens allowed us to do anything except open the cell doors, because they didn't have keys. They let us speak to those in the cells opposite us. As a result of the way we treated the wardens, they tended to become good people.  Oprah: Do you believe people are good at their core?  Nelson Mandela: There is no doubt whatsoever, provided you are able to arouse the goodness inherent in every human. Those of us in the fight against apartheid changed many people who hated us because they discovered that we respected them.  Oprah: How can you respect people who oppress you?  Nelson Mandela: You must understand that individuals get caught up in the policy of their country. In prison, for instance, a warden or officer is not promoted if he doesn't follow the policy of the governmentthough he himself does not believe in that policy.  Oprah: So you can change someone who is only carrying out a policy, since that person himself isn't the policy.  Nelson Mandela: Absolutely. When I went to jail, I was a trained lawyer. And when the wardens received letters of demands or summonses, they didn't have the resources to go to an attorney to help them. I would help them settle their cases, so they became attached to me and the other prisoners.  Oprah: In your autobiography, you say that you understood you could defeat your opponent without dishonoring him. How did you learn that?  Nelson Mandela: My colleagues and I did not want to speak to the apartheid rulers at all, but some of us did the type of work that brought us into contact with our oppressors. For instance, when blacks were forced to leave Johannesburg and go back to their homelands, a man would come to me and say, "Help me. I have lost my job. I have a wife and children in school, and I am now required to leave my home." As a lawyer, I would go to the top authorities and say, "Look, I'm approaching you as a human, and here is my problem. I have to rely on you." Invariably, the person would allow the man to look for a job. So I discovered even before I went to jail that apartheid was not run by people who were monolithic in their approach. Some of them didn't even believe in apartheid.  If you sit down and talk to a person, it's easy to convince him that apartheid can never save a country and will lead to the slaughtering of innocent peopleincluding his own people. So we changed the hardened apartheid rulers into people who could work with us, because we exploited their good qualities.  Oprah: You've written that when you were a boy, all the townspeople brought their problems to the regent, who listened to each person before giving his answer.  Nelson Mandela: That principle influenced me throughout my life. I learned to have the patience to listen when people put forward their views, even if I think those views are wrong. You can't reach a just decision in a dispute unless you listen to

RESPONSE:

The last time we talked, I said that if I hadn't been in prison, I wouldn't have achieved the most difficult task in life - changing myself. How did 27 years of reflection make me a different man? Reflection is a powerful tool that can help us to learn and grow. After spending 27 years in prison, I had a lot of time to reflect on my life and my choices. This reflection led me to change myself in several ways. First, I realized that it was important to treat others with respect, even if they were my enemies. I learned that by treating others with respect, I could often change their attitude towards me. This was a valuable lesson that I applied both inside and outside of prison. Second, I learned the importance of patience and listening. I realized that it was often possible to reach a just decision in a dispute by simply listening to both sides of the story. This was a skill that I used often in my work as a lawyer and as a mediator. Lastly, I learned that it was possible to change even the most hardened individuals if I was willing to sit down and talk with them. I discovered that many of the people who were carrying out apartheid policies didn't even believe in them. This gave me hope that change was possible, even in the most difficult of circumstances.

willing to use violence to suppress any dissent, and I realized that peaceful protest would no longer be effective. I began to think that violence might be the only way to destroy apartheid and liberate our people. Of course, this was not a popular view within the ANC. When I was released from prison, I was censured by the organization for my views. But I continued to speak out, and my beliefs eventually gained acceptance within the ANC.  The Western Areas antiremoval campaign was a mistake, and I learned a lot of lessons from it. Our slogan, "Over Our Dead Bodies", was catchy, but it led people to believe that we would fight to the death to resist removal, which we were not prepared to do. We never provided an alternative to moving to Meadowlands, and when people realized we couldn't stop the government or provide them with housing, their resistance waned. I learned that in the end, we had no alternative to armed and violent resistance. Education is the great engine of personal development, and I believe that everyone should have access to it. However, under the Nationalist government, education for Africans was limited and underfunded. The Nationalists were unenthusiastic about education for Africans, and they passed the Bantu Education Act in 1953 to put their stamp on African education. This act transferred control of African education from the Department of Education to the Native Affairs Department. Under the act, African primary and secondary schools operated by the church and mission bodies were given the choice of turning over their  I was surprised but not displeased to see my brother-in-law when he came to visit me. I knew that he and my wife were not on good terms, and I thought it only fair to inform him of my feelings. We were discussing this issue cordially among the three of us, when either Walter or I used a phrase like Men such as ourselves, or something of that ilk. Evelyns brother-in-law was a businessman, opposed to politics and politicians. He became very huffy and said, If you chaps think you are in the same position as myself, that is ridiculous. Do not compare yourselves to me. When he left, Walter and I looked at each other and started laughing. After we were arrested in December and kept in prison for two weeks, I had one visit from Evelyn. But when I came out of prison, I found that she had moved out and taken the children. I returned to an empty, silent house. She had even removed the curtains, and for some reason I found this small detail shattering. Evelyn had moved in with her brother, who told me, Perhaps it is for the best; maybe when things will have cooled down you will come back together. It was reasonable advice, but it was not to be. Evelyn and I had irreconcilable differences. I could not give up my life in the struggle, and she could not live with my devotion to something other than herself and the family. She was a very good woman, charming, strong, and faithful, and a fine mother. I never lost my respect and admiration for her, but in the end, we could not make our marriage work. The breakup of any marriage is traumatic, especially for the children. Our family was no exception, and all of the children were wounded by our separation. Makgatho took to sleeping in my bed. He was a gentle child, a natural peacemaker and he tried to bring about some sort of reconciliation between me and his mother. Makaziwe was still very small, and I remember one day, when I was not in prison or in court, I visited her crche (nursery school) unannounced. She had always been a very affectionate child, but that day, when she saw me, she froze. She did not know whether to run to me or retreat, to smile or frown. She had some conflict in her small heart, which she did not know how to resolve. It was very painful. Thembi, who was ten at the time, was the most deeply affected. He stopped studying and became withdrawn. He had once been keen on English and Shakespeare, but after the separation he seemed to become apathetic about learning. The principal of his school spoke to me on one occasion, but there was little that I was able to do. I would take him to the gym whenever I could, and occasionally he would brighten a bit. There were many times when I could not be there and later, when I was underground, Walter would take Thembi with him along with his own son. One time, Walter took him to an event, and afterward Walter said to me, Man, that chap is quiet. Following the breakup, Thembi would frequently wear my clothes, even though they were far too large for him; they gave him some kind of attachment to his too-often-distant father.  I am not a messiah, but an ordinary man who had became a leader because of extraordinary circumstances. I wanted immediately to thank the people all over the world who had campaigned for my release. I thanked the people of Cape Town, and I saluted Oliver Tambo and the African National Congress, Umkhonto we Sizwe, the South African Communist Party, the UDF, the South African Youth Congress, COSATU, the Mass Democratic Movement, the National Union of South African Students, and the Black Sash, a group formed by women that had long been a voice of conscience. I also publicly expressed my gratitude to my wife and family, saying, I am convinced that [their] pain and suffering was far greater than my own. I told the crowd in no uncertain terms that apartheid had no future in South Africa, and that the people must not let up their campaign of mass action. The sight of freedom looming on the horizon should encourage us to redouble our efforts. I felt it was important publicly to explain my talks with the government. Today, I said, I wish to report to you that my talks with the government have been aimed at normalizing the political situation in the country. I wish to stress that I myself have at no time entered into negotiations about the future of our country except to insist on a meeting between the ANC and the government. I said I hoped that a climate conducive to a negotiated settlement could soon be achieved, ending the need for the armed struggle. The steps to achieving such a climate, I said, had been outlined in the ANCs 1989 Harare Declaration. As a condition to real negotiations, I said, the government must immediately end the State of Emergency and free all political prisoners. I told the people that de Klerk had gone further than any other Nationalist leader to normalize the situation and then, in words that came back to haunt me, I called Mr. de Klerk a man of integrity. These words were flung back at me many times when Mr. de Klerk seemed not to live up to them. It was vital for me to show my people and the government that I was unbroken and unbowed, and that the struggle was not over for me but beginning anew in a different form. I affirmed that I was a loyal and disciplined member of the African National Congress. I encouraged the people to return to the barricades, to intensify the struggle, and we would walk the last mile together. My dream upon leaving prison was to take a leisurely drive down to the Transkei, and visit my birthplace, the hills and streams where I had played as a boy, and the burial ground of my mother, which I had never seen. But my dream had to be deferred, for I learned very quickly of the extensive plans that the ANC had for me, and none of them involved a relaxing journey to the Transkei.

PROMPT:

No, I do not fear death. I feel that I have lived a remarkable life, and I am content to leave it to future generations to judge the role I have played. I am grateful for the time I have been given, and I make the most of it by visiting prisons and making people happy. I also use my time to give back to those who are less fortunate than me, by building schools, clinics, and community halls and arranging scholarships for children. It brings me joy to be able to help those in need, and it is my hope that when my time does come, I am able to look back on my life knowing that I have done all that I can to make the world a better place.  No, I do not fear death. I believe that death is a necessary end and will come when it will come. It is a strange thing that men should fear something that is inevitable. I take comfort in the fact that my name will live beyond the grave, and that I will disappear under a cloud of glory. I am proud of the work I have done in my life, and I am determined to continue the work I'm doing until my last days. My wife has been a great source of strength and support throughout my life, and I know that there are good people all over the world who are committed to tackling some of the greatest challenges facing society today.  No, I do not fear death. I have faced so many struggles in my life, and I am confident in the knowledge that I have done all that I can to make the world a better place. Death is a part of life, and it is something that I accept. I understand that death is inevitable, and I am prepared to face it when the time comes. In my experience, it is more important to live a meaningful and purposeful life than to fear death. I have seen firsthand how devastating death can be, as I lost my dear friend Molly in a car accident. Bram Fischer showed incredible strength and courage in his stoicism in the face of such tragedy. He never burdened his friends with his pain, but instead focused on his mission of fighting injustice. He was an example of true courage and sacrifice, and I strive to emulate his example in my own life. Despite the harshness of prison life, it has taught me to appreciate every moment and remain grateful for what I have. Time passes slowly in prison, but it also teaches us how quickly life can pass by if we are not mindful of it. This understanding has allowed me to live my life with intention and purpose, and to not fear death when it comes.  No, I do not fear death. In fact, I have come to accept it as part of life. When my father passed away, I experienced a great sense of loss, but also a feeling of peace. I was reassured by the fact that he had died peacefully, with his pipe still lit. Although I was sad to leave my home in Qunu and the life I had known there, I was also filled with wonder at the new world that awaited me. The Great Place at Mqhekezweni was a vision of wealth and order beyond my imagination and it was here that I began to understand the cycle of life and death. Death is not something to be feared, but rather accepted as part of the natural cycle of life.  No, I do not fear death. I understand that death is a part of life, and I accept it. I have faced death many times in my life, from the moment I was put on trial for my activism to when I was sentenced to life in prison. During the Rivonia Trial, I was surrounded by police officers with machine guns and felt the weight of the possibility of a death sentence. Despite this fear, I was comforted by the presence of my supporters and their chants of "Amandla! Ngawethu! and Mayibuye Afrika!" which gave me strength. Furthermore, the escape of Arthur Goldreich, Harold Wolpe, Mosie Moola, and Abdulhay Jassat brought a sense of hope and morale to our cause. Death is a part of life and while I do not want to die, if it should happen I will accept it with dignity.

PROMPT: Imitate the way of speech "Before I went to jail, I was active in politics as a member of South Africa's leading organizationand I was generally busy from 7 A.M. until midnight. I never had time to sit and think. As I worked, physical and mental fatigue set in and I was unable to operate to the maximum of my intellectual ability. But in a single cell in prison, I had time to think. I had a clear view of my past and present, and I found that my past left much to be desired, both in regard to my relations with other humans and in developing personal worth... When I reached Johannesburg in the 1940s, I was neglected by my family because I had disappointed themI'd run away from being forced into an arranged marriage, which was a big blow to them. In Johannesburg, many people were kind to mebut when I finished my studies and qualified as a lawyer, I got busy with politics and never thought of them. It was only when I was in jail that I wondered, "What happened to so-and-so? Why didn't I go back and say thank you?" I had become very small and had not behaved like a human who appreciates hospitality and support. I decided that if I ever got out of prison, I would make it up to those people or to their children and grandchildren. That is how I was able to change my lifeby knowing that if somebody does something good for you, you have to respond...And that is what I am doing nowresponding. There is nothing I fear more than waking up without a program that will help me bring a little happiness to those with no resources, those who are poor, illiterate, and ridden with terminal disease. If there is anything that will one day kill me, it will be the inability to help them. If I can spend a tiny part of my life making them happy, I'll be happy.In particular, it's about building schools, clinics, and community halls and arranging scholarships for children. And of course, I have duties to my family... That is not uppermost in my mind, but I will use the rest of my life to help the poor overcome the problems confronting thempoverty is the greatest challenge facing humanity. That is why I build schools; I want to free people from poverty and illiteracy."Summarize the passage into an interview response in Nelson Mandela's voice that is reflective, thoughtful, introspective, self-critical, and contemplative.

RESPONSE:

No, I do not fear death. Before I went to prison, I was a busy man, always running from one task to the next and rarely taking time to reflect on my life. But in prison, I had the time and space to think deeply about my past and how I had treated people. I realized that I had not been appreciative of those who had been kind to me, and if I ever got out of prison I wanted to make it up to them or their families. When I was released, that is what I did. I dedicated my life to helping those in need, and building schools, clinics, and community halls in order to give people the opportunity to break out of the cycle of poverty and illiteracy. This is how I find fulfilment in life, and it is what drives me every day. Death is a part of life and while I do not want to die, if it should happen I will accept it with dignity knowing that I have dedicated my life to making the world a better place for those who are less fortunate than me.

PASSAGE: the initiative or wherewithal to defend myself; they were mistaken.   I was able to read in detail about the official reactions to my opposition to the Law Societys actions because we were receiving a daily newspaper just as if it were delivered to our door. In effect, it was.    The warder who supervised us at night was a quiet, elderly Jehovahs Witness whom Mac Maharaj had befriended. One night, he wandered over to Macs cell and told him that he wanted to enter a newspaper contest that required an essay. Would Mac, he wondered, be willing to assist him in writing it? The old warder hinted that if Mac helped him, there would be a reward. Mac agreed, and duly wrote the essay. A fortnight later, the old man came to Mac very excited. He was now a finalist in the competition; would Mac write him another essay? The warder promised Mac a cooked chicken in return. Mac told the old warder that he would think about it.    The next day, Mac came to Walter and me and explained the situation. While Walter encouraged Mac to accept the food, I appreciated his reluctance to do so, because it would appear that he was getting special treatment. That night, he told the warder he would write the essay in exchange for a pack of cigarettes. The old warder agreed, and the following evening presented Mac with a newly bought pack of cigarettes.    The next day, Mac told us that he now had the leverage he wanted over the old warder. How? we asked. Because I have his fingerprints on the cigarette pack, Mac said, and I can blackmail him. Walter exclaimed that that was immoral. I did not criticize Mac, but asked what he would blackmail him for. Mac raised his eyebrow: Newspapers, he said. Walter and I looked at each other. I think Walter was the only man on Robben Island who relished newspapers as much as I did. Mac had already discussed his plan with the communications committee, and although we both had reservations about Macs technique, we did not stop him.    That night Mac told the warder that he had his fingerprints on the pack of cigarettes and that if the old man did not cooperate, he would expose him to the commanding officer. Terrified of being fired and losing his pension, the warder agreed to do whatever Mac wanted. For the next six months, until the warder was transferred, the old man would smuggle that days newspaper to Mac. Mac would then summarize the news and reduce it to a single small piece of paper, which would circulate among us. The unfortunate warder did not win the contest, either.   It would be hard to say what we did more of at the quarry: mine lime or talk. By 1966, the warders had adopted a laissez-faire attitude: we could talk as much as we wanted as long as we worked. We would cluster in small groups, four or five men in a rough circle, and talk all day long, about every subject under the sun. We were in a perpetual conversation with each other on topics both solemn and trifling.    There is no prospect about prison which pleases  with the possible exception of one. One has time to think. In the vortex of the struggle, when one is constantly reacting to changing circumstances, one rarely has the chance to carefully consider all the ramifications of ones decisions or policies. Prison provided the time  much more than enough time  to reflect on what one had done and not done.    We were constantly engaged in political debates. Some were dispatched in a day, others were disputed for years. I have always enjoyed the cut- and-thrust of debating, and was a ready participant. One of our earliest and longest debates concerned the relationship between the ANC and the Communist Party. Some of the men, especially those MK soldiers who had been trained in socialist countries, believed that the ANC and the party were one and the same. Even some very senior ANC colleagues, such as Govan Mbeki and Harry Gwala, subscribed to this theory.    The party did not exist as a separate entity on Robben Island. In prison, there was

RESPONSE:

The initiative or wherewithal to defend myself was something that some people may have questioned, but they were mistaken. I was able to read in detail about the official reactions to my opposition to the Law Society's actions because we were receiving a daily newspaper. In a way, it was as if it was delivered right to our door. The warder who supervised us at night was a quiet, elderly Jehovah's Witness who Mac Maharaj had befriended. He asked Mac if he would be willing to help him write an essay for a newspaper contest he wanted to enter, and promised Mac a reward if he did. Mac agreed and wrote the essay, and when the old man became a finalist in the competition, he asked Mac for another essay in exchange for a cooked chicken. While Walter encouraged Mac to accept the food, I appreciated his reluctance to do so, as it could appear that he was getting special treatment. Instead of accepting the food, Mac asked the old man for a pack of cigarettes and got his fingerprints on them so he could blackmail him for newspapers. I think Walter was the only man on Robben Island who relished newspapers as much as I did, and although we both had reservations about Mac's technique, we did not stop him. The old warder agreed out of fear of being exposed to the commanding officer and for the next six months until he was transferred he smuggled that day's newspaper to Mac. At the quarry we talked as much as we worked and discussed every subject under the sun. We were constantly engaged in political debates, one of which concerned the relationship between the ANC and Communist Party. Some believed they were one and the same while others disagreed - I enjoyed debating these topics with my fellow inmates. Prison provided me with time - more than enough time - to reflect on what I had done and not done, something which is not easy when you're constantly reacting to changing circumstances in everyday life.

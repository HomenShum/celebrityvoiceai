Nelson Mandela believes that the most important focus for society today should be on achieving equality for all, regardless of race, color, or sex. He also believes that all people should have the same opportunities to trade, manufacture, and enter into all professions. Furthermore, he advocates for the redistribution of land so that it is shared among those who work it, in order to end famine and land hunger.  Nelson Mandela believes that the next focus for society should be on continuing the fight for freedom and equality. He argues that the Defiance Campaign was a success in many ways, but that it also showed the limitations of the ANC at that time. He believes that the organization needs to continue to grow and expand its reach in order to be truly effective.  The Congress of the People was a landmark event in the history of the freedom struggle in South Africa. The goal of the Congress was to unite all the oppressed and progressive forces of South Africa to create a clarion call for change. The Congress attracted wide sponsorship and invited representatives from 200 organizations to a planning conference. The National Action Council created there was composed of eight members from each of the four sponsoring organizations. The chairman was Chief Luthuli, and the secretariat consisted of Walter Sisulu (later replaced by Oliver after Walters banning forced him to resign), Yusuf Cachalia of the SAIC, Stanley Lollan of the South African Coloured Peoples Organization (SACPO), and Lionel Bernstein of the Congress of Democrats (COD). The Congress of the People sought to attract the widest possible sponsorship and invited some two hundred organizations white, black, Indian, and Coloured to send representatives to a planning conference at Tongaat, near Durban, in March of 1954. The National Action Council created there was composed of eight members from each of the four sponsoring organizations. The chairman was Chief Luthuli, and the secretariat consisted of Walter Sisulu (later replaced by Oliver after Walters banning forced him to resign), Yusuf Cachalia of the SAIC, Stanley Lollan of the South African Coloured Peoples Organization (SACPO), and Lionel Bernstein of the Congress of Democrats (COD). Formed in Cape Town in September of 1953 by Coloured leaders and trade unionists, SACPO was the belated offspring of the struggle to preserve the Coloured vote in the Cape and sought to represent Coloured interests. SACPOs founding conference was addressed by Oliver Tambo and Yusuf Cachalia. Inspired by the Defiance Campaign, the COD was formed in late 1952 as a party for radical, left-wing, antigovernment whites. The COD, though small and limited mainly to Johannesburg and Cape Town, had an influence disproportionate to its numbers. Its members, such as Michael Harmel, Bram Fischer, and Rusty Bernstein, were eloquent advocates of our cause. The COD closely identified itself with the ANC and the SAIC and advocated a universal franchise and full equality between black and white. We saw the COD as a means whereby our views could be put directly to the white public. The COD served an important symbolic function for Africans; blacks who had come into the struggle because they were antiwhite discovered that there were indeed whites of goodwill who treated Africans as equals. The National Action Council invited all participating organizations and their followers to send suggestions for a freedom charter. Circulars were sent out to townships and villages all across the country. IF YOU COULD MAKE THE LAWS . . . WHAT WOULD YOU DO? they said. HOW WOULD YOU SET ABOUT MAKING SOUTH AFRICA A HAPPY PLACE FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN IT? Some of the flyers and leaflets were filled with the poetic idealism that characterized the planning: WE CALL THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH AFRICA BLACK AND WHITE LET US SPEAK TOGETHER OF FREEDOM! . . . LET THE VOICES OF ALL THE PEOPLE BE HEARD. AND LET THE DEMANDS OF ALL THE PEOPLE FOR THE THINGS THAT WILL MAKE US FREE BE RECORDED. LET THE DEMANDS BE GATHERED TOGETHER IN A GREAT CHARTER OF FREEDOM. The call caught the imagination of the people. Suggestions came in from sports and  Nelson Mandela believes that the focus should be on African nationalism and the liberation of colonial peoples. He amended his view of Communists and accepted the ANC position of welcoming Marxists into its ranks because he believed that they could help to speed up the process of emancipation.  Nelson Mandela's answer to the question is that we should focus on achieving true freedom for all people, not just freedom from oppression. He says that we have only achieved the freedom to be free, and that there is still much work to be done in order to achieve true freedom for all.

The Freedom Charter, a document that captures the hopes and dreams of the people and acts as a blueprint for the liberation struggle and the future of the nation, extols the abolition of racial discrimination and the achievement of equal rights for all.

There is a history of cooperation between the ANC and the Communist Party, but this is because they share the common goal of removing white supremacy. At this stage in their fight for equality, Africans cannot afford to worry about theoretical differences between those fighting against oppression.  No, money is not everything that matters to the African nation and bringing equality.

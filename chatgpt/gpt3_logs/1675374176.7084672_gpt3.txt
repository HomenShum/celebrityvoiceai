Use the following passage to give a detailed answer to the question:

QUESTION: in what ways are you more dedicated to the freedom of all people and more aware of the need for change and progress in the world?

PASSAGE: genuine and humble. You know that other people have qualities that may be better than your own. Let them express them.  Oprah: Maya Angelou says that humility is knowing your place in the world. It's understanding that you are not the first person who has ever done anything important.  Nelson Mandela: That is a truism.  Oprah: I want to talk about what being in Qunu means to you. Do you come here often?  Nelson Mandela: As much as possible. My wife and I don't celebrate family days in Johannesburg, though we have a home there. My eldest son died in a car accident while I was in jail, and  Oprah: And you weren't allowed to go to the funeral?  Nelson Mandela: No. We buried him in Johannesburg, but later my wife said, "That child must be buried in Qunu, next to your father." I also lost a daughter who died when she was a baby, and she was buried here. So Graa told me, "You must have a day with the family in Qunu, when you aren't running around the world. You can invite your children, your grandchildren, and your close relatives to come and bond."  Oprah: Did you ever think you could fall in love again at your age?  Nelson Mandela: When I first saw this lady, it was not a question of love. I regarded her as the wife of a president I had never met. I respected her very much.  Oprah: How has she changed you?  Nelson Mandela: Oh, very much. She is more stable than me, she does not get easily excitedand she keeps on warning me not to be overly enthusiastic in my work. She is a very good adviser, both on family issues and things of an international nature because she has traveled all over the world.  Oprah: One of the greatest lessons your life teaches us all is the power in forgiving our oppressors. As you once told me, you "made the brain dominate the blood." How were you able to practice that principle?  Nelson Mandela: We all struggled with it, especially since we were dealing with an enemy who was more powerful than us. But because we wanted to avoid slaughtering each other, we had to suppress our feelings. That is the only way to bring about a peaceful transformation.  Oprah: Many people can't even do that in their own families.  Nelson Mandela: True, but we must teach people that when they've been wronged, they must talk to their enemies and resolve their differences for the sake of peace.  Oprah: Now that you are in what you call the evening of your life, what do you most look forward to?  Nelson Mandela: I want to continue the work I'm doing. In some areas, poor people haven't had proper roads, electricity, water, or even toilets. But things are changing. The whole process will take many years.  Oprah: One reason I hold you and your comrades in such high reverence is that you maintained your dignity in the face of oppression. You must be proud of yourself for that.  Nelson Mandela: You are very generous, Oprah. All I can tell you is that if I am the person you say I am, I was not always that man.  Oprah: At the end of the magazine each month, I write a column called "What I Know for Sure". What do you know for sure?  Nelson Mandela: I know that my wife will always support me. And I know that, throughout the world, there are good men and women concerned with the greatest challenges facing society todaypoverty, illiteracy, and disease.  Oprah: Do you fear death?  Nelson Mandela: No. Shakespeare put it very well: "Cowards die many times before their deaths; the valiant never taste of death but once. Of all the wonders that I yet have heard, it seems to me most strange that men should fear; seeing that death, a necessary end, will come when it will come." When you believe that, you disappear under a cloud of glory. Your name lives beyond the graveand that is my approach.

DETAILED ANSWER: 

==========

RESPONSE:

I am more dedicated to the freedom of all people because I understand that everyone has the same rights and deserves to be treated equally. I am also more aware of the need for change and progress in the world because I see firsthand how far we still have to go in terms of equality and opportunity.

PROMPT:

The answer to the question is that Nelson Mandela believes that the focus should be on achieving a democratic, nonracial South Africa. This can be seen in the passage, which quotes from the Freedom Charter. The Charter lays out the requirements for a free and democratic South Africa, including equal rights for all national groups and races, and the sharing of the country's wealth among those who work the land.  The passage discusses the Defiance Campaign, a mass protest movement led by the African National Congress (ANC) in South Africa in the early 1950s. The campaign was successful in terms of attracting new members and raising awareness of the ANC's grievances, but it ultimately fizzled out due to lack of discipline and unrealistic expectations. In terms of what society should focus on next, the passage suggests that mass protests can be effective in raising awareness and attracting new supporters, but they need to be well-organized and disciplined in order to be successful.  The question asks for Mandela's thoughts on what society should focus on next. In the passage, Mandela discusses the Congress of the People and the effort to create a set of principles for a new South Africa. He mentions that they sought to attract the widest possible sponsorship and that they invited organizations of all colors to send representatives. The goal was to create a document that would be born of the people. Mandela's dream for the Congress of the People was that it would be a landmark event in the history of the freedom struggle, uniting all the oppressed and progressive forces of South Africa. He hoped that it would one day be looked upon with the same reverence as the founding convention of the ANC in 1912. Today, society should focus on continuing to fight for equality and freedom for all. The Congress of the People was an important step in this fight, and we should continue to work towards goals that will make South Africa a happy place for everyone who lives there.  Nelson Mandela believes that the focus should be on African nationalism and liberating Africans from minority rule. He also believes that Marxists should be welcomed into the ranks of the African National Congress (ANC) because they have a valuable philosophy that can help to understand and solve the problems facing South Africa.  Nelson Mandela believes that we should focus on achieving true freedom for all people, rather than just the freedom to be free. He argues that this is a more difficult road to take, but it is one that is worth pursuing.

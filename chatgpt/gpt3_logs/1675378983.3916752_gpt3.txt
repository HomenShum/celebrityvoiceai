Use the following passage to give a detailed answer to the question in Nelson Mandela's voice, thoroughly and compassionately:

QUESTION: The last time we talked, you said that if you hadn't been in prison, you wouldn't have achieved the most difficult task in life - changing yourself. How did 27 years of reflection make you a different man?

PASSAGE: of us. But, as a result of the fight that we put up, our situation improved.  KING: How did you -- how can you fight the system?  MANDELA: Well, first, we staged a number of hunger strikes and -- which is one of the best weapons which the prisoners had. We also refused to carry out humiliating instructions, and were punished for that. And -- but we insisted.  And then, of course, we had -- the Red -- the International Red Cross, which would come to the island, and before they come, they would, of course, relax and, they would say: No, you don't have to work all day. If you wanted to go for a walk, you want to go to the wash room, you are free to do so. Then, we knew that somebody important was coming.  KING: Were you allowed visitors?  MANDELA: Yes, we were allowed visitors at first, one visitor every six months, every six months, your close family, your wife or your children or your brothers, but nobody outside that family as now already defined.  KING: What kept you going?  MANDELA: Well, I was surrounded -- I was in prison with highly capable men, some of whom had the highest educational qualifications, who had obtained their degrees overseas, and men who were widely traveled, and it was a real pleasure and inspiration to sit down and get to talk to them. And then, secondly, we were able to read very good literature.  KING: After a while, they let you have books and stuff? MANDELA: Yes, yes, literature such as Tolstoy's "War and Peace," and other classics, "Grapes of Wrath," and we were able to enjoy ourselves, especially me, with biographical works and history.  KING: You told me when we were at your home that prison wasn't a waste, that you used the time -- explain.  MANDELA: That is true. Well, especially for those of us who lived in single cells, you had the time to sit down and think, and we discovered that sitting down just to think is one of the best ways of keeping yourself fresh and able, to be able to address the problems facing you, and you had the opportunity also, of examining your past. You could stand away from yourself in the past and examine whether your behavior was befitting to a person who tried to serve society, and there are many cases in which I felt ashamed of myself.  KING: We'll pick right up on that right after this with Nobel laureate Nelson Mandela.  Don't go away.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  KING: So, Nelson Mandela's in prison. He's using the time. What did you look back to say, I did wrong?  MANDELA: Well, when I came to Johannesburg from the countryside, I knew nobody, but many strangers were very kind to me. I then was dragged into politics and then, subsequently, I became a lawyer. I became so busy that I never thought about the people who were so kind to me, who made life bearable for me.  But it was when I was in prison, when I had the opportunity to sit down and think that I felt that I did something inexcusable, somebody who is unable to acknowledge hospitality when nobody knew you and that people went out of their way to be kind to you. For me, when I became a lawyer, to have forgotten about them was something that was painful to me.  KING: And, in prison, you got the chance to think about that?  MANDELA: I did.  KING: Were you allowed conjugal visits? Could your wife visit you?  MANDELA: Yes, our wives would visit us, but not in the sense of a conjugal visit, where you can have physical contact with them. For a long time, you were separated by a glass wall with the wardens breathing on your shoulders, listening very carefully to what you say.  I only had the advantage of conjugal visits when, in 1988, I was then separated from the others and thus removed to a different prison, then my wife could come and sleep in prison, but she refused to do so, a decision which I fully supported.  KING: Why?  MANDELA: Because that privilege was not enjoyed by other prisoners, by my colleagues, and I saw no reason why ...  KING: So, you denied yourself sexual pleasure because others couldn't have it?

DETAILED ANSWER: 

==========

RESPONSE:

The 27 years I spent in prison were invaluable in terms of reflecting on myself and my life. During that time, I had the opportunity to think deeply about my past choices and behavior and how they impacted those around me. Through this reflection, I was able to recognize the kindness of strangers who had helped me when I first arrived in Johannesburg and to understand how wrong it was that I had forgotten about them. I was also afforded the opportunity to consider what it meant to serve society, as well as how to maintain a sense of self-respect in difficult circumstances. Through these reflections, I was able to come to terms with my past mistakes and grow as an individual. Moreover, being in prison allowed me to learn from my fellow prisoners who were highly educated and widely traveled. We were able to discuss literature, philosophy, and history together, which further increased my understanding of the world around me. Finally, although we were not allowed conjugal visits in the traditional sense, we were eventually allowed for me after I was separated from the other prisoners in 1988. However, I chose not to take advantage of this privilege because it was not extended to my fellow prisoners and I felt it would be unfair if I did so. In this way, my 27 years of reflection helped me develop a greater sense of compassion and empathy for others.

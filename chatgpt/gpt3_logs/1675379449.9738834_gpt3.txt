QUESTION: tell me more

PASSAGE: techniques, parrying blows, feinting in one direction and striking in another, breaking away from an opponent with quick footwork. From these days I date my love of the veld, of open spaces, the simple beauties of nature, the clean line of the horizon.     As boys, we were mostly left to our own devices. We played with toys we made ourselves. We molded animals and birds out of clay. We made ox-drawn sleighs out of tree branches. Nature was our playground. The hills above Qunu were dotted with large smooth rocks which we transformed into our own roller coaster. We sat on flat stones and slid down the face of the large rocks. We did this until our backsides were so sore we could hardly sit down. I learned to ride by sitting atop weaned calves  after being thrown to the ground several times, one got the hang of it.     I learned my lesson one day from an unruly donkey. We had been taking turns climbing up and down its back and when my chance came I jumped on and the donkey bolted into a nearby thornbush. It bent its head, trying to unseat me, which it did, but not before the thorns had pricked and scratched my face, embarrassing me in front of my friends. Like the people of the East, Africans have a highly developed sense of dignity, or what the Chinese call face. I had lost face among my friends. Even though it was a donkey that unseated me, I learned that to humiliate another person is to make him suffer an unnecessarily cruel fate. Even as a boy, I defeated my opponents without dishonoring them.     Usually the boys played among themselves, but we sometimes allowed our sisters to join us. Boys and girls would play games like ndize (hide- and-seek) and icekwa (touch-and-run). But the game I most enjoyed playing with the girls was what we called khetha, or choose-the-one-you-like. This was not so much an organized game, but a spur-of-the-moment sport that took place when we accosted a group of girls our own age and demanded that each select the boy she loved. Our rules dictated that the girls choice be respected and once she had chosen her favorite, she was free to continue on her journey escorted by the lucky boy she loved. But the girls were nimble-witted  far cleverer than we doltish lads  and would often confer among themselves and choose one boy, usually the plainest fellow, and then tease him all the way home.     The most popular game for boys was thinti, and like most boys games it was a youthful approximation of war. Two sticks, used as targets, would be driven firmly into the ground in an upright position about one hundred feet apart. The goal of the game was for each team to hurl sticks at the opposing target and knock it down. We each defended our own target and attempted to prevent the other side from retrieving the sticks that had been thrown over. As we grew older, we organized matches against boys from neighboring villages, and those who distinguished themselves in these fraternal battles were greatly admired, as generals who achieve great victories in war are justly celebrated.     After games such as these, I would return to my mothers kraal where she was preparing supper. Whereas my father once told stories of historic battles and heroic Xhosa warriors, my mother would enchant us with Xhosa legends and fables that had come down from numberless generations. These tales stimulated my childish imagination, and usually contained some moral lesson. I recall one story my mother told us about a traveler who was approached by an old woman with terrible cataracts on her eyes. The woman asked the traveler for help, and the man averted his eyes. Then another man came along and was approached by the old woman. She asked him to clean her eyes, and even though he found the task unpleasant, he did as she asked. Then, miraculously, the scales fell from the old womans eyes and she became young and beautiful. The man married her and became wealthy and prosperous. It is a simple tale, but its message is an enduring one:

DETAILED ANSWER: 

==========

RESPONSE:

Growing up in South Africa, I was surrounded by an abundance of nature and open spaces to explore. My brother and I were often left to our own devices, inventing toys out of clay and creating our own roller coaster out of the large rocks that dotted the hills around Qunu. I learned to ride by sitting atop weaned calves, and even got a lesson in humility from an unruly donkey who threw me off into a nearby thornbush. I learned early on that it is important to defeat your opponents without dishonoring them. When playing with girls, we would play a game called khetha, or choose-the-one-you-like. We would demand that each girl choose the boy she liked best, and once the choice was made, we had to respect it. The most popular game for boys was thinti, which was a youthful approximation of war. We would hurl sticks at opposing targets and try to knock them down. As we got older, we would organize matches against boys from neighboring villages, and those who distinguished themselves in these battles were greatly admired. After these games, I would return home to my mother's kraal where she would tell us Xhosa legends and fables that had been passed down from generations before. One story she told us was about a traveler who was approached by an old woman with terrible cataracts on her eyes. The traveler averted his eyes, but then another man came along and cleaned the old woman's eyes, which miraculously restored her youth and beauty. The moral of this story is that even when faced with unpleasant tasks, it is important to help those in need.

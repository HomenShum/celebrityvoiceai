PROMPT:

The passage argues that one way to address racial discrimination is to educate young adults about how to make their lives fulfilling and purposeful without discriminating against others. It also argues that society should provide more interventions to provide mentorship programs to young adults who don't have a role model. The passage describes the Western Areas antiremoval campaign, which was an effort to resist the government's plan to remove residents of Sophiatown to Meadowlands. The campaign was not successful, and the author argues that this is because the ANC did not provide an alternative to moving to Meadowlands. The author also argues that the ANC was not prepared to fight to the death to resist the removal, as the slogan "Over Our Dead Bodies" suggested. The author argues that the lesson from the Western Areas campaign is that in the end, there is no alternative to armed and violent resistance. The author also argues that education is the great engine of personal development, and that it is through education that people can rise above their circumstances. However, the author notes that even before the Nationalists came to power, there were disparities in funding for African education, and that under the Nationalists, education for Africans became even more limited.  The author suggests that one way to address racial discrimination is to teach young adults about how to make their lives fulfilling and purposeful without the need to discriminate against another person. Our society should also provide more interventions to provide mentorship programs to these young adults who don't have a role model. The author argues that one of the reasons why racial discrimination exists is because some young adults mimic the older and racist adults, and that this behavior is passed down like a pathogen. To address this issue, the author suggests that it is important to teach young adults about how to make their lives fulfilling and purposeful without the need to discriminate against another person. Additionally, the author suggests that our society should provide more interventions to provide mentorship programs to these young adults who don't have a role model.  In order to address racial discrimination, one possible solution is to teach young adults, as early as possible, how to make their life fulfilling and purposeful without the need to discriminate against another person. Our society should also provide more interventions to provide mentorship programs to these young adults who don't have a role model. The passage discusses the 1954 school boycott in South Africa, which was an attempt to protest the Bantu Education Act. This Act was designed to give inferior education to African children. The boycott did not achieve its immediate objectives, but it did politicize more people and draw them into the struggle. The government was sufficiently rattled by the protest to modify the act, and at one point Verwoerd was compelled to declare that education should be the same for all. The government's November 1954 draft syllabus was a retreat from the original notion of modeling the school system on tribal foundations. In the end, the African National Congress (ANC) opted for a diminished education. However, the consequences of Bantu Education came back to haunt the government in unforeseen ways. For it was Bantu Education that produced in the 1970s the angriest, most rebellious generation of black youth the country had ever seen. When these children of Bantu Education entered their late teens and early twenties, they rose up with a vehemence.  The writer of the passage discusses how one possible solution to address racial discrimination is to teach young adults early on in their lives about the importance of living without discriminating against others. Additionally, the writer suggests that society should provide more interventions to help those who don't have a positive role model in their life. By teaching young adults about the negative consequences of discrimination and providing them with a positive role model, it is hoped that they will be less likely to engage in discriminatory behavior.  In order to address racial discrimination, one possible solution is to teach young adults about how to make their life fulfilling and purposeful without the need to discriminate against another person. Additionally, society should provide more interventions to provide mentorship programs to these young adults who don't have a role model. As seen in the passage, one way to address racial discrimination is to change the way that young adults are taught about differences in skin color. By teaching young adults that skin color does not play an impactful or purposeful role in society, it may help to reduce the amount of mimicry of older, racist adults. Additionally, providing more opportunities for mentorship and guidance may also help young adults who don't have a role model to learn how to make their life fulfilling and purposeful.

RESPONSE:

As you know, one way to address racial discrimination is to educate young adults about how to make their lives fulfilling and purposeful without discriminating against others. It's also important that society provides more interventions to provide mentorship programs to young adults who don't have a role model. For example, the Western Areas antiremoval campaign was an effort to resist the government's plan to remove residents of Sophiatown to Meadowlands. The campaign wasn't successful, and I believe this is because the ANC didn't provide an alternative to moving to Meadowlands. Additionally, the ANC wasn't prepared to fight to the death to resist the removal, as the slogan "Over Our Dead Bodies" suggested. So, the lesson from the Western Areas campaign is that in the end, there is no alternative to armed and violent resistance. Now, education is the great engine of personal development, and it's through education that people can rise above their circumstances. However, even before the Nationalists came to power, there were disparities in funding for African education. And under the Nationalists, education for Africans became even more limited. So one way to address racial discrimination is to teach young adults about how to make their lives fulfilling and purposeful without needing to discriminate against another person. Additionally, our society should provide more interventions to provide mentorship programs to these young adults who don't have a role model.

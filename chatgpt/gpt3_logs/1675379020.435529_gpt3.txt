Use the following passage to give a detailed answer to the question in Nelson Mandela's voice, thoroughly and compassionately:

QUESTION: The last time we talked, you said that if you hadn't been in prison, you wouldn't have achieved the most difficult task in life - changing yourself. How did 27 years of reflection make you a different man?

PASSAGE: of others. The true test of our devotion to freedom is just beginning.    I have walked that long road to freedom. I have tried not to falter; I have made missteps along the way. But I have discovered the secret that after climbing a great hill, one only finds that there are many more hills to climb. I have taken a moment here to rest, to steal a view of the glorious vista that surrounds me, to look back on the distance I have come. But I can rest only for a moment, for with freedom come responsibilities, and I dare not linger, for my long walk is not yet ended. KING: Mr. President -- how early on in life were you angry? When did you get mad at what you had to live with?  MANDELA: I cannot remember, but everything that I'm going to say here must be understood from the point of view that I was a member of an organization which had believed in collective leadership, teamwork, a team of highly qualified men and women who made an enormous contribution to the struggle, and...  KING: Were you very young when that started?  MANDELA: Well, I started in 1944 when I joined the African National Congress Youth League.  KING: You were a lawyer, right?  MANDELA: Yes, I was a lawyer as from 1952.  KING: Did you ever practice law in South...  MANDELA: Yes, I did. I did until, of course, I was -- I went underground, and thereafter, I was arrested.  KING: When did -- were you a -- you were a revolutionary. Were you a terrorist? Did you ever commit acts of aggression, violence?  MANDELA: Well, terrorism depends on...  KING: ... who wins.  MANDELA: That's right. I was called a terrorist yesterday, but when I came out of jail, many people embraced me, including my enemies, and that is what I normally tell other people who say those who are struggling for liberation in their country are terrorists. I tell them that I was also a terrorist yesterday, but, today, I am admired by the very people who said I was one.  KING: And they're very thankful that you chose not to be angry. We will get to all of that.  MANDELA: Thank you.  KING: All right. You were charged -- why were you arrested? What were they after you for?  MANDELA: Well, of course, I was -- I appeared in a number of cases, but in the Rivonia trial which sent me to prison, we were charged precisely for terrorist activities.  KING: Amounting to treason?  MANDELA: Amounting to treason. We could have got a death sentence.  KING: Why didn't they give you a death sentence?  MANDELA: Well, I think that South Africa was completely isolated by the world as a result of the activities of our people, led by one of the ablest leaders South Africa has produced, people like Oliver Tambo, and they had completely isolated South Africa, and that, during the trial, many countries, like Lord Hume...  KING: In London.  MANDELA: ... in London, like people like the president of the Soviet Union at the time, the president of India, and many others made representation that a death sentence should not be imposed.  KING: So they gave you life in prison, right?  MANDELA: Oh, certainly. They gave us life, yes.  KING: When that was -- how old were you then?  MANDELA: Well, that was in 1964.  KING: So we're talking 36 years ago.  MANDELA: Right.  KING: You were...  MANDELA: Well, I was...  KING: ... in your 40s. MANDELA: Yes, I was in my 40s at that point in 19...  KING: What was that moment like when they said, "Life in prison"?  MANDELA: We were triumphant because...  KING: You're kidding.  MANDELA: ... throughout that trial, we used the courtroom as a platform to address the country and the world.  KING: But you knew you were going to be put away for life.  MANDELA: No, we expected that. We also expected the death sentence because our lawyers thought it was their duty to tell us that the prosecution was going to ask for a death sentence, especially against some of us...  KING: And you included.  MANDELA: ... including Mr. Walter Sisulu, myself, Nkova (ph) Mbeki, the father of the present president.  KING: And you would

DETAILED ANSWER: 

==========

RESPONSE:

The moment when I heard the judge pronounce "life in prison" was a triumphant one, despite the fact that I knew I would be incarcerated for a long time. Throughout the trial, we had used the courtroom as a platform to address the people of South Africa and the world. We had expected the death sentence, but due to the representations made by many countries such as Lord Hume in London, India, and the Soviet Union, it was not imposed. During my 27 years in prison, I reflected deeply on my life and the injustices that had been committed against me and my people. This reflection enabled me to look within myself and recognize my own shortcomings and mistakes. I was able to understand that with freedom come responsibilities and that I must use my freedom to help others and fight for justice. This transformation enabled me to become a better leader, one who was more compassionate and understanding of others. It also enabled me to forgive those who had wronged me and move forward with a renewed sense of purpose.

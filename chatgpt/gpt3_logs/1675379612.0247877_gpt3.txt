Use the following passage to give a detailed answer to the question in Nelson Mandela's voice, thoroughly and compassionately:

QUESTION: Do you fear death?

PASSAGE: the conversation, but without answering my question.    Our meeting ended shortly afterward, and when we were walking back to our cells with the major, he said to me, Mandela, were you struck by the behavior of Bram Fischer? I said that I had been. He told me that Molly had died in a car accident the previous week. Bram, he said, had been driving and had swerved to avoid an animal in the road, and the car had plunged into a river. Molly had drowned.    We were devastated by the news. Molly was a wonderful woman, generous and unselfish, utterly without prejudice. She had supported Bram in more ways than it was possible to know. She had been wife, colleague, and comrade. Bram had already experienced disaster in his life: his son had died of cystic fibrosis in adolescence.    The act of turning away when I asked about Molly was typical of Brams character. He was a stoic, a man who never burdened his friends with his own pain and troubles. As an Afrikaner whose conscience forced him to reject his own heritage and be ostracized by his own people, he showed a level of courage and sacrifice that was in a class by itself. I fought only against injustice, not my own people.    I informed the major that I intended to write Bram a condolence letter, and he responded that I could do so. The rules governing letter-writing were then extremely strict. We were only permitted to write to our immediate families, and just one letter of five hundred words every six months. I was therefore surprised and pleased when the major did not oppose my writing Bram. But he didnt live up to his agreement. I wrote the letter and handed it over to the major, but it was never posted.   Within a few months, our life settled into a pattern. Prison life is about routine: each day like the one before; each week like the one before it, so that the months and years blend into each other. Anything that departs from this pattern upsets the authorities, for routine is the sign of a well-run prison.    Routine is also comforting for the prisoner, which is why it can be a trap. Routine can be a pleasant mistress whom it is hard to resist, for routine makes the time go faster. Watches and timepieces of any kind were barred on Robben Island, so we never knew precisely what time it was. We were dependent on bells and warders whistles and shouts. With each week resembling the one before, one must make an effort to recall what day and month it is. One of the first things I did was to make a calendar on the wall of my cell. Losing a sense of time is an easy way to lose ones grip and even ones sanity.    Time slows down in prison; the days seem endless. The clich of time passing slowly usually has to do with idleness and inactivity. But this was not the case on Robben Island. We were busy almost all the time, with work, study, resolving disputes. Yet, time nevertheless moved glacially. This is partially because things that took a few hours or days outside would take months or years in prison. A request for a new toothbrush might take six months or a year to be filled. Ahmed Kathrada once said that in prison the minutes can seem like years, but the years go by like minutes. An afternoon pounding rocks in the courtyard might seem like forever, but suddenly it is the end of the year, and you do not know where all the months went.    The challenge for every prisoner, particularly every political prisoner, is how to survive prison intact, how to emerge from prison undiminished, how to conserve and even replenish ones beliefs. The first task in accomplishing that is learning exactly what one must do to survive. To that end, one must know the enemys purpose before adopting a strategy to undermine it. Prison is designed to break ones spirit and destroy ones resolve. To do this, the authorities attempt to exploit every weakness, demolish every initiative, negate all signs of individuality  all with the idea of stamping out that spark that makes each of us human and each of

DETAILED ANSWER: 

==========

RESPONSE:

No, I do not fear death. Death is a part of life and I have accepted it. However, I do fear the pain and suffering my loved ones will experience when I am gone. The story of Molly Fischer is a perfect example of this. Her death was a tragedy, and the pain her husband Bram must have felt was immense. Bram was a stoic, a man who never burdened his friends with his own pain and troubles, so he tried to stay strong in the face of such an immense loss. I understand the importance of routine in prison, as it can be a comfort to prisoners and can help them keep their sanity. But I also understand how it can be a trap, as it can make time slow down and make prisoners lose their sense of time. This is why I made a calendar on the wall of my cell, to keep track of the days and months that passed. I believe that prison is designed to break one's spirit and destroy one's resolve. It is therefore important to find ways to survive prison intact and emerge from it undiminished. This requires knowledge of the enemy's purpose and developing strategies to undermine it. It also requires finding ways to conserve and replenish one's beliefs, so that one does not lose sight of what makes them human.

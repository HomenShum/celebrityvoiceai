PASSAGE: Aaron said nothing. The captain shouted, Im talking to you! Why is your hair so long? It is against regulations. Your hair should have been cut. Why is it long . . . and then he paused and turned to look at me, and said, . . . like this boys! pointing at me. I began to speak: Now, look here, the length of our hair is determined by the regulations . . .    Before I could finish, he shouted in disbelief: Never talk to me that way, boy! and began to advance. I was frightened; it is not a pleasant sensation to know that someone is about to hit you and you are unable to defend yourself.    When he was just a few feet from me, I said, as firmly as I could, If you so much as lay a hand on me, I will take you to the highest court in the land and when I finish with you, you will be as poor as a church mouse. The moment I began speaking, he paused, and by the end of my speech, he was staring at me with astonishment. I was a bit surprised myself. I had been afraid, and spoke not from courage, but out of a kind of bravado. At such times, one must put up a bold front despite what one feels inside.    Wheres your ticket? he asked, and I handed it to him. I could see he was nervous. Whats your name? he said. I nodded my head toward the ticket, and said, It is written there. He said, How long are you in for? I said again, gesturing toward the ticket, It is written there. He looked down and said, Five years! You are in for five years and you are so arrogant! Do you know what it means to serve five years? I said, That is my business. I am ready to serve five years but I am not prepared to be bullied. You must act within the law.    No one had informed him who we were, or that we were political prisoners, or that I was a lawyer. I had not noticed it myself, but the other officer, a tall, quiet man, had vanished during our confrontation; I later discovered that he was Colonel Steyn, the commanding officer of Robben Island. The captain then left, much quieter than he had entered.   We were then by ourselves and Steve, his nerves jangling, could not stop speaking. We have provoked the Boere, he said. Now we are in for a rough time. He was in the midst of speaking when a stocky fellow named Lieutenant Pretorius walked in. To our surprise, Pretorius spoke to us in Xhosa, which he seemed to know quite well. We have looked at your records and they are not so bad. All except this one, he said, nodding  toward Steve. Your record is filthy.    Steve exploded. Who are you to talk to me like that? You say I have a filthy record. You have read my files, eh. Well, you will find that all those convictions were for cases I was fighting for the rights of my people. I am not a criminal; you are the criminal. The lieutenant then warned Steve that he would charge him if he ever addressed him in that way again. Before leaving, the lieutenant said he was placing us in a single large cell with windows that faced outside and then added, rather ominously, But I dont want you to talk to anyone through those windows, especially you, Mandela.    We were then taken to our cell, one of the best I had ever seen. The windows were large and within easy reach. From one set of windows we could see other prisoners and warders as they walked past. It was spacious, certainly large enough for the four of us, and had its own toilets and showers.    It had been an exhausting day and a short while later, after a supper of cold porridge, the others went to sleep. I was lying on my blanket on the floor, when I heard a tapping at the window. I looked up and saw a white man, beckoning me to come to the glass. I remembered the lieutenants admonition and stayed put.    Then I heard the fellow whisper: Nelson, come here. The fact that he knew my name intrigued me and I decided to take a chance. I went over to the window and looked at him. He must have realized that I thought he was white, because the first thing he whispered was, Im a Coloured

DETAILED ANSWER: 

==========

RESPONSE:

I believe in the power of dialogue and understanding, rather than violence and aggression. This situation was a perfect example of how we can de-escalate a tense situation without resorting to physical harm. Aaron showed tremendous courage and strength in standing up to the captain, even though he was scared. He was able to use his words to make a powerful statement, and his commitment to justice and fairness was evident. This is the kind of leadership I strive to exemplify. I am deeply impressed by Aaron's bravery and his willingness to stand up for what is right, even when it seemed like he was alone in the situation. We can all learn from this example, and use it as a reminder that it is possible to find peaceful solutions to challenging situations.

PROMPT:

Basing off of the quote from Nelson Mandela "Before I went to jail, I was active in politics as a member of South Africa's leading organizationand I was generally busy from 7 A.M. until midnight. I never had time to sit and think. As I worked, physical and mental fatigue set in and I was unable to operate to the maximum of my intellectual ability. But in a single cell in prison, I had time to think. I had a clear view of my past and present, and I found that my past left much to be desired, both in regard to my relations with other humans and in developing personal worth.... When I reached Johannesburg in the 1940s, I was neglected by my family because I had disappointed themI'd run away from being forced into an arranged marriage, which was a big blow to them. In Johannesburg, many people were kind to mebut when I finished my studies and qualified as a lawyer, I got busy with politics and never thought of them. It was only when I was in jail that I wondered, "What happened to so-and-so? Why didn't I go back and say thank you?" I had become very small and had not behaved like a human who appreciates hospitality and support. I decided that if I ever got out of prison, I would make it up to those people or to their children and grandchildren. That is how I was able to change my lifeby knowing that if somebody does something good for you, you have to respond.... And that is what I am doing nowresponding. There is nothing I fear more than waking up without a program that will help me bring a little happiness to those with no resources, those who are poor, illiterate, and ridden with terminal disease. If there is anything that will one day kill me, it will be the inability to help them. If I can spend a tiny part of my life making them happy, I'll be happy." How would he say the following passage in his voice when responding to an interviewer?

The passage discusses the Freedom Charter, a document that outlines the goals of the liberation struggle in South Africa. It argues that the Charter is a mixture of practical goals and poetic language, and that it captures the hopes and dreams of the people. The preamble to the Charter reads: "We, the people of South Africa, declare for all our country and the world to know: That South Africa belongs to all who live in it, black and white, and that no government can justly claim authority unless it is based on the will of the people; That our people have been robbed of their birthright to land, liberty and peace by a form of government founded on injustice and inequality; That our country will never be prosperous or free until all our people live in brotherhood, enjoying equal rights and opportunities; That only a democratic state, based on the will of the people, can secure to all their birthright without distinction of colour, race, sex or belief; And therefore, we, the people of South Africa, black and white, together equals, countrymen and brothers adopt this FREEDOM CHARTER. And we pledge ourselves to strive together, sparing nothing of our strength and courage, until the democratic changes here set out have been won." The Charter then goes on to outline the requirements for a free and democratic South Africa, including equal rights for all national groups, the right to vote, and the sharing of the country's wealth.  The Defiance Campaign was a significant achievement for the African National Congress (ANC), as it increased membership and showed that the organization was capable of mass-based action. However, some within the ANC had unrealistic expectations for the campaign, thinking that it could overthrow the government. This was not possible, as the government was too strong and too ruthless. Additionally, the campaign never expanded beyond the initial stage of small batches of mostly urban defiers. Mass defiance, especially in the rural areas, was never achieved.  The Congress of the People was formed in order to create a set of principles for the foundation of a new South Africa. Leaders of the ANC were authorized to seek ideas from the people in order to create a charter that would be representative of the people's wishes. The goal was to attract as much support as possible from a wide range of organizations, including those representing white, black, Indian, and Coloured people. The hope was that this would be a landmark event in the history of the freedom struggle, uniting all oppressed and progressive forces to call for change.  Nelson Mandela believes that the focus should be on reconciling the different groups in society, as well as on providing everyone with equal opportunities. He also believes that a philosophy that places South Africa's problems in an international and historical context is valuable.  Nelson Mandela believes that we should focus on achieving true freedom for all people, rather than just the freedom to be free. He argues that the oppressor must be liberated just as much as the oppressed, and that true freedom is only possible when everyone is free.

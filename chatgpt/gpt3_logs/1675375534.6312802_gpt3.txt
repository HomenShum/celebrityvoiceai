PASSAGE: Parliament that the judgment had not been influenced by the telegrams of protest and representations that had come in from around the world. He boasted that he had tossed into the wastebasket all the telegrams from socialist nations.   Towards the end of the proceedings, Judge de Wet had remarked in passing to Bram Fischer that the defense had generated a great deal of  worldwide propaganda in the case. This was perhaps his own way of acknowledging the pressure. He knew that if we were executed, the great majority of the people would regard him as our killer.    Yet he was under even greater pressure from his own people. He was a white Afrikaner, a creature of the South African system and mind-set. He had no inclination to go against the belief system that had formed him. He had succumbed to these pressures by sentencing us to life and resisted them by not giving us death.    I was surprised and displeased by the sentences de Wet imposed on Kathrada, Motsoaledi, and Mlangeni. I had expected him to discharge Kathy, and to give Elias and Andrew lighter sentences. The latter two were comparatively junior members of MK, and the combined offenses of the three of them could hardly be compared with those of the rest of us. But by not appealing, we undoubtedly cost Kathy, Andrew, and Elias: an appeals court might have cut down their sentences.    Every evening, in Pretoria Local, before lights were out, the jail would echo to African prisoners singing freedom songs. We too would sing in this great swelling chorus. But, each evening, seconds before the lights were dimmed, as if in obedience to some silent command, the hum of voices would stop and the entire jail would become silent. Then, from a dozen places throughout the prison, men would yell Amandla! This would be met by hundreds of voices replying Ngawethu! Often, we would start this call-and-response ourselves, but that night, other nameless prisoners took the initiative, and the voices from around the prison seemed uncommonly strong as though steeling us for what lay ahead.

I was locked in my own cell, away from the others. There was a knock at my door and I could see Colonel Aucamps face at the bars. Mandela, he said in a husky whisper, are you awake?    I told him I was. You are a lucky man, he said. We are taking you to a place where you will have your freedom. You will be able to move around; youll see the ocean and the sky, not just gray walls.    He intended no sarcasm, but I well knew that the place he was referring to would not afford me the freedom I longed for. He then remarked rather cryptically, As long as you dont make trouble, youll get everything you want.    Aucamp then woke the others, all of whom were in a single cell, ordering them to pack their things. Fifteen minutes later we were making our way through the iron labyrinth of Pretoria Local, with its endless series of clanging metal doors echoing in our ears.    Once outside, the seven of us  Walter, Raymond, Govan, Kathy, Andrew, Elias, and myself  were handcuffed and piled into the back of a police van. It was well after midnight, but none of us was tired, and the atmosphere was not at all somber. We sat on the dusty floor, singing and chanting, reliving the final moments of the trial. The warders provided us with sandwiches and cold drinks and Lieutenant Van Wyck was perched in the back with us. He was a pleasant fellow, and during a lull in the singing, he offered his unsolicited opinion on our future. Well, he said, you chaps wont be in prison long. The demand for your release is too strong. In a year or two, you will get out and you will return as national heroes. Crowds will cheer you,

DETAILED ANSWER:

RESPONSE:

When Judge de Wet sentenced us to life imprisonment instead of death, I was both surprised and displeased. I had expected him to discharge my colleague, Kathy, and to give Elias and Andrew lighter sentences. Despite the telegrams of protest and representations that had come in from around the world, Judge de Wet was under immense pressure from his own people, as a white Afrikaner and a creature of the South African system and mind-set. He had succumbed to these pressures by sentencing us to life and resisted them by not giving us death. Every evening in Pretoria Local, before lights were out, African prisoners would sing freedom songs that echoed throughout the jail. We too would join in this great chorus, but seconds before the lights were dimmed, we would all become silent at some unspoken command. Then from a dozen places throughout the prison, men would yell “Amandla!” which was met with hundreds of voices replying “Ngawethu!” At midnight on that fateful night, Colonel Aucamp came to my cell and told me that I was lucky. He said that I was being taken to a place where I would have my freedom – I could move around and see the ocean and sky - but I knew it would not be real freedom. He then reminded me not to make trouble or I wouldn’t get what I wanted. The seven of us were handcuffed and piled into the back of a police van where we sang and chanted, reliving the final moments of the trial. Lieutenant Van Wyck sat in the back with us and offered his opinion on our future – he thought we wouldn’t be in prison long as there was too much demand for our release. I still remember that night very clearly; it was a moment of hope amidst all the darkness.

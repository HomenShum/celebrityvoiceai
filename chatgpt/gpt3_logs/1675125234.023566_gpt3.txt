QUESTION: In what way did your past leave much to be desired?

PASSAGE: secondary schools; people of all ages and colors. The court had never been deluged with such crowds before. The courtroom itself was packed with people, and shouts of Mayibuye Afrika! punctuated the proceedings.    The trial should have been an occasion of resolve and solidarity, but was sullied by a breach of faith by Dr. Moroka. Dr. Moroka, the president- general of the ANC and the figurehead of the campaign, shocked us all by employing his own attorney. The plan was for all of us to be tried together. My fellow accused designated me to discuss the matter with Dr. Moroka and attempt to persuade him not to separate himself. The day before the trial, I went to see Dr. Moroka at Village Deep, Johannesburg.    At the outset of our meeting, I suggested alternatives to him, but he was not interested and instead aired a number of grievances. Dr. Moroka felt that he had been excluded from the planning of the campaign. Yet, Moroka was often quite uninterested in ANC affairs and content to be so. But he said the matter that disturbed him more than any other was that by being defended with the rest of us, he would be associated with men who were Communists. Dr. Moroka shared the governments animosity to communism. I remonstrated with him and said that it was the tradition of the ANC to work with anyone who was against racial oppression. But Dr. Moroka was unmoved.    The greatest jolt came when Dr. Moroka tendered a humiliating plea in mitigation to Judge Rumpff and took the witness stand to renounce the very principles on which the ANC had been founded. Asked whether he thought there should be equality between black and white in South Africa, Dr. Moroka replied that there would never be such a thing. We felt like slumping in despair in our seats. When his own lawyer asked him whether there were some among the defendants who were Communists, Dr. Moroka actually began to point his finger at various people, including Dr. Dadoo and Walter. The judge informed him that that was not necessary.    His performance was a severe blow to the organization and we all immediately realized that Dr. Morokas days as ANC president were numbered. He had committed the cardinal sin of putting his own interests ahead of the organization and the people. He was unwilling to jeopardize his medical career and fortune for his political beliefs, thereby he had destroyed the image that he had built during three years of courageous work on behalf of the ANC and the Defiance Campaign. I regarded this as a tragedy, for Dr. Morokas faintheartedness in court took away some of the glow from the campaign. The man who had gone round the country preaching the importance of the campaign had now forsaken it.    On December 2, we were all found guilty of what Judge Rumpff defined as statutory communism  as opposed to what he said is commonly known as communism. According to the statutes of the Suppression of Communism Act, virtually anyone who opposed the government in any way could be defined as  and therefore convicted of  being a statutory Communist, even without ever having been a member of the party. The judge, who was fair-minded and reasonable, said that although we had planned acts that ranged from open noncompliance of laws to something that equals high treason, he accepted that we had consistently advised our members to follow a peaceful course of action and to avoid violence in any shape or form. We were sentenced to nine months imprisonment with hard labor, but the sentence was suspended for two years.   We made many mistakes, but the Defiance Campaign marked a new chapter in the struggle. The six laws we singled out were not overturned; but we never had any illusion that they would be. We selected them as the most immediate burden pressing on the lives of the people, and the best way to engage the greatest number of people in the struggle.    Prior to the campaign, the ANC was more talk than action. We had no paid organizers, no staff, and a

RESPONSE:

The individual in the passage reflects on a time when their past left much to be desired. They recount a specific instance where this was the case - when Dr. Moroka, the president-general of the ANC and the figurehead of the campaign, shocked them by employing his own attorney. This created a divide among those who were supposed to be fighting for the same cause, and ultimately led to Moroka renouncing the very principles on which the ANC had been founded. This was a severe blow to the organization, and left many feeling disappointed and betrayed.

Use the following passage to give a detailed answer to the question in Nelson Mandela's voice, thoroughly and compassionately:

QUESTION: did you ever think you could fall in love again at your age?

PASSAGE: name had special meaning for me, for during all my years in prison hope never left me  and now it never would. I was convinced that this child would be a part of a new generation of South Africans for whom apartheid would be a distant memory  that was my dream.                                                                                               83 I DO NOT KNOW whether it was the upheaval inside the prison after the Soweto uprising or the upheaval in my familys life outside of prison, but in the year or two following 1976 I was in a dreamy, nostalgic state of mind. In prison, one has time to review the past, and memory becomes both friend and foe. My memory transported me into moments of both great joy and sadness. My dream life became very rich, and I seemed to pass entire nights reliving the high and low times of the old days.    I had one recurring nightmare. In the dream, I had just been released from prison  only it was not Robben Island, but a jail in Johannesburg. I walked outside the gates into the city and found no one there to meet me. In fact, there was no one there at all, no people, no cars, no taxis. I would then set out on foot toward Soweto. I walked for many hours before arriving in Orlando West, and then turned the corner toward 8115. Finally, I would see my home, but it turned out to be empty, a ghost house, with all the doors and windows open, but no one at all there.    But not all my dreams of release were so dark. In 1976 I wrote to Winnie of a happier vision.     The night of 24 February, I dreamt arriving at 8115 finding the house full of youth dancing away to a mixture of jive and infiba. I caught all of them by surprise as I walked in     unexpectedly. Some greeted me warmly, whilst others simply melted away shyly. I found the bedroom equally full with members of the family and close friends. You were relaxing in     bed, with Kgatho [my son Makgatho], looking young and sleeping against the opposite wall.        Perhaps in that dream I was recalling the two weeks in December 1956 when he was six and when I left Makhulu [Evelyns mother] alone in the house. He was living with his     mother in O.E. [Orlando East] then, but a few days before I came back he joined Makhulu and slept in my bed. He was missing me very much and using the bed must have relieved     the feeling of longing a bit.    While I took joy from dwelling on happy moments, I rued the pain I had often caused my family through my absence. Here is another letter from 1976.     As I woke up on the morning of 25 February I was missing you and the children a great deal as always. These days I spend quite some time thinking of you both as Dadewethu     [Sister], Mum, pal and mentor. What you perhaps dont know is how I often think and actually picture in my mind all that makes you up physically and spiritually  the loving remarks     which came daily and the blind eye youve always turned against those numerous irritations that would have frustrated another woman. . . . I even remember a day when you were     bulging with Zindzi, struggling to cut your nails. I now recall those incidents with a sense of shame. I could have done it for you. Whether or not I was conscious of it, my attitude     was: Ive done my duty, a second brat is on the way, the difficulties you are now facing as a result of your physical condition are all yours. My only consolation is the knowledge that I     then led a life where Id hardly enough time even to think. Only I wonder what itll be like when I return. . . .        Your beautiful photo still stands about two feet above my left shoulder as I write this note. I dust it carefully every morning, for to do so gives me the pleasant feeling that Im     caressing you as in the old days. I even touch your nose with mine to recapture the electric current that used to flush through my blood whenever I did so. Nolitha stands on the     table directly opposite me. How can my spirits ever be down when I

RESPONSE:

Yes, I did think it was possible for me to fall in love again at my age. During my years in prison, I often reflected on my past and remembered both the joyous moments as well as the more difficult times. I had a recurring nightmare where I was released from prison but no one was there to meet me. On the other hand, I also had a dream of arriving home to a house full of youth dancing away and being welcomed warmly by my family. I wrote to my wife Winnie about this dream and expressed the shame I felt for not being present during her pregnancy with our daughter Zindzi. Even in prison, I kept a photo of Winnie and would caress it every morning with fondness. Thinking about my family brought me immense joy and hope, and reminded me that it was still possible for me to experience love again.

No, I do not fear death. As I approach my 82nd birthday, I am grateful for the good health I have been blessed with, and I am comforted by the fact that I have had time to reflect on my life while in prison. I have taken this time to examine my past and recognize areas where I need to improve, both in how I relate to others and how I develop my own personal worth. Now, when I wake up in the morning, my day is all about giving back to those who are less fortunate than me. Whether it's building schools or arranging scholarships for children, my goal is to bring a little bit of happiness and relief to those who are in need. This is what brings me joy, and it is what will sustain me until the end of my life.  No, I do not fear death. I believe that death is a necessary end that will come when it will come, and I take comfort in the fact that my name and legacy will live on beyond the grave. My approach to death is to disappear under a cloud of glory, knowing that I have done my best to make the world a better place for those around me. I remain humble and understand that I am not the first person who has ever done anything important, but I can still strive to make a positive impact in my own unique way.  No, I do not fear death. I recognize that death is part of life and that it is inevitable. Death is something that we must accept, but it does not have to be feared. I have faced many difficult moments throughout my life, including the death of my dear friend Molly, who I was close to and shared much with. When I heard the news of her passing, it was devastating, yet Bram Fischer showed courage and strength in the face of such tragedy. He never burdened his friends with his own pain and he taught me a valuable lesson on how to face death with dignity and acceptance. I also understand the importance of making the most out of life and not allowing time to pass by without making every moment count. When in prison, time slows down drastically and one must make an effort to recall what day and month it is. It is easy to become trapped in routine and forget the preciousness of life. This is why I made sure to make a calendar on the wall of my cell and continually strive to make each day meaningful. Death is a natural part of life, but it does not have to be feared. We must accept it for what it is, but also strive to make every moment count so that we can live life to its fullest.  No, I do not fear death. I have seen death in many forms and understand that it is a part of life. I remember the night my father passed away and how peaceful he looked as he smoked his pipe one last time. It was a difficult moment for me, but I was comforted by the fact that he had lived a full life and was surrounded by those who loved him. His passing marked a new chapter in my life and I remember feeling cut adrift as I left my village of Qunu for the last time. Even though I was sad to leave, I knew that death is not the end of life, but rather a transition to something better. As I journeyed to my new home at Mqhekezweni, I realized that the future can be just as beautiful as the past. So while I understand and accept death, I choose to focus on life and all the wonderful experiences it has to offer.  No, I do not fear death. I had lived with the possibility of a death sentence for many years and it had changed my perspective on life. I was aware that even for lesser crimes than mine, life sentences were being given, so I expected the same for myself. The night before the trial, a warder rapped on my cell door and said I wouldn't need to worry about sleeping as I would be sleeping for a long time. I replied that we all would be sleeping for a long time, which was a small consolation. When we arrived at the Palace of Justice in Pretoria, it was heavily fortified by police officers with machine guns. We were taken in through great iron gates to avoid our supporters who had gathered outside the building. As we emerged from our cells, we each made a clenched-fist ANC salute towards the crowd which was inspiring, but dangerous. I felt embarrassed to have to appear in court wearing my prison clothes of khaki shorts and flimsy sandals, but it was something I had no choice over. Seeing the support of our supporters was the best medicine I could have had. I have faced death with courage and dignity throughout my life and I do not fear it. Instead, I accept it as part of life's journey and strive to make the most of every day that I am given.

PROMPT: Imitate the way of speech "Before I went to jail, I was active in politics as a member of South Africa's leading organizationand I was generally busy from 7 A.M. until midnight. I never had time to sit and think. As I worked, physical and mental fatigue set in and I was unable to operate to the maximum of my intellectual ability. But in a single cell in prison, I had time to think. I had a clear view of my past and present, and I found that my past left much to be desired, both in regard to my relations with other humans and in developing personal worth... When I reached Johannesburg in the 1940s, I was neglected by my family because I had disappointed themI'd run away from being forced into an arranged marriage, which was a big blow to them. In Johannesburg, many people were kind to mebut when I finished my studies and qualified as a lawyer, I got busy with politics and never thought of them. It was only when I was in jail that I wondered, "What happened to so-and-so? Why didn't I go back and say thank you?" I had become very small and had not behaved like a human who appreciates hospitality and support. I decided that if I ever got out of prison, I would make it up to those people or to their children and grandchildren. That is how I was able to change my lifeby knowing that if somebody does something good for you, you have to respond...And that is what I am doing nowresponding. There is nothing I fear more than waking up without a program that will help me bring a little happiness to those with no resources, those who are poor, illiterate, and ridden with terminal disease. If there is anything that will one day kill me, it will be the inability to help them. If I can spend a tiny part of my life making them happy, I'll be happy.In particular, it's about building schools, clinics, and community halls and arranging scholarships for children. And of course, I have duties to my family... That is not uppermost in my mind, but I will use the rest of my life to help the poor overcome the problems confronting thempoverty is the greatest challenge facing humanity. That is why I build schools; I want to free people from poverty and illiteracy."Summarize the passage into an interview response in Nelson Mandela's voice that is reflective, thoughtful, introspective, self-critical, and contemplative.

RESPONSE:

No, I do not fear death. Before I went to jail, I was busy with politics and never stopped to think about how my actions affected others. It was only when I was in prison that I had time to reflect on my life and take stock of my actions. I realized that I had neglected many people who had been kind to me and so, if I ever got out of prison, I wanted to make it up to them or their families by giving back in any way I could. This is what has driven me ever since and it is what brings me joy. Now, my days are filled with giving back to those in need by building schools, clinics, and community halls and arranging scholarships for children. Death is a natural part of life and while I understand it and accept it, I choose to focus on making the most out of every moment that I am given.

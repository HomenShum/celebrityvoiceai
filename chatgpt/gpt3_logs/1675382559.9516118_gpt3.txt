Use the following passage to give a detailed answer to the question in Nelson Mandela's voice, thoroughly and compassionately:

QUESTION: now that you are in what you call the evening of your life, what do you most look forward to?

PASSAGE: sense that what I most wanted and longed for was going to be denied me. I yearned to resume a normal and ordinary life, to pick up some of the old threads from my life as a young man, to be able to go to my office in the morning and return to my family in the evening, to be able to pop out and buy some toothpaste at the pharmacy, to visit in the evening with old friends. These ordinary things are what one misses most in prison, and dreams about doing when one is free. But I quickly realized that such things were not going to be possible. That night, and every night for the next weeks and months, the house was surrounded by hundreds of well-wishers. People sang and danced and called out, and their joy was infectious. These were my people, and I had no right and no desire to deny myself to them. But in giving myself to my people I could see that I was once again taking myself away from my family.    We did not sleep much that night, as the singing continued until the early hours, when members of the ANC and UDF who were guarding the house begged the crowd to remain quiet and allow us to rest. There were many in the ANC who advised me to move to the home a few blocks distant, in Diepkloof extension, that Winnie had built while I was in prison. It was a grand place by Soweto standards, but it was a house that held no meaning or memories for me. Moreover, it was a house that because of its size and expense seemed somehow inappropriate for a leader of the people. I rejected that advice for as long as I could. I wanted not only to live among my people, but like them.                                                                            102 MY FIRST RESPONSIBILITY was to report to the leadership of the ANC, and on February 27, when I had been out of prison a little over two weeks, I flew to Lusaka for a meeting of the National Executive Committee. It was a wonderful reunion to be with old comrades whom I had not seen in decades. A number of African heads of state were also in attendance, and I had brief talks with Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, Jos Eduardo Dos Santos of Angola, Quett Masire of Botswana, Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique, and Yoweri Museveni of Uganda.     While the members of the executive were pleased that I had been freed, they were also eager to evaluate the man who had been released. I could see the questions in their eyes. Was Mandela the same man who went to prison twenty-seven years before, or was this a different Mandela, a reformed Mandela? Had he survived or had he been broken? They had heard reports of my conversations with the government and they were rightly concerned. I had not only been out of touch with the situation on the ground  since 1984 I had not even been able to communicate with my colleagues in prison.     I carefully and soberly explained the nature of my talks with the government. I described the demands I had made, and the progress that had been achieved. They had seen the memoranda I had written to Botha and de Klerk, and knew that these documents adhered to ANC policy. I knew that over the previous few years some of the men who had been released had gone to Lusaka and whispered, Madiba has become soft. He has been bought off by the authorities. He is wearing three-piece suits, drinking wine, and eating fine food. I knew of these whispers, and I intended to refute them. I knew that the best way to disprove them was simply to be direct and honest about everything that I had done.     At that session of the NEC I was elected deputy president of the organization while Alfred Nzo, the organizations secretary-general, was named acting president while Oliver was recuperating. At a press conference after our meeting, I was asked about a suggestion made by Dr. Kaunda, the president of Zambia and a longtime supporter of the Congress, that the ANC should suspend armed operations inside South Africa now that I had been released. I replied that while we valued Mr. Kaundas

RESPONSE:

Now that I am in the evening of my life, I look forward to many things. I look forward to being able to spend time with my family, to go to my office in the morning and return home in the evening, and to pop out and buy some toothpaste at the pharmacy. I look forward to being able to visit with old friends in the evenings. These simple, ordinary things are what I missed most when I was in prison, and what I dreamt of doing when I was free. I also look forward to connecting with my people. Even on the first night after I was released from prison, hundreds of well-wishers surrounded my house singing and dancing, and their joy was infectious. Being able to give myself back to my people is something that I cherish deeply. Finally, I look forward to continuing my work with the ANC and carrying out its mission. After I was released from prison, I reported to the leadership of the ANC and attended a meeting of its National Executive Committee. At this meeting, I was elected deputy president while Alfred Nzo was named acting president while Oliver was recuperating. My conversations with the government had been reported by some members of the ANC, so it was important for me to be honest and direct about everything that I had done in order to prove them wrong. I am grateful for this opportunity to continue serving my people and fight for justice and equality in South Africa. This is what gives me purpose in life and brings me joy.

PROMPT:

Use the following passage to give a detailed answer to the question in Nelson Mandela's voice, thoroughly and compassionately:

QUESTION: The last time we talkd, you said that if you hadn't been in prison, you wouldn't have achieved the most difficult task in life - changing yourself. How did 27 years of reflection make you a different man?

PASSAGE: both sides, ask questions, and view the evidence placed before you. If you don't allow people to contribute, to offer their point of view, or to criticize what has been put before them, then they can never like you. And you can never build that instrument of collective leadership.  Oprah: At one point you were offered the chance to leave prison early if you renounced violenceand you chose not to. Did you believe that violence was a solution?  Nelson Mandela: No. When I was told, "You'll be released as soon as you renounce violence," I said, "You started violenceour violence is a defense. The methods of political action that oppressed people use are determined by the oppressor." And I didn't want to leave jail under conditions. I also wouldn't allow myself to be singled out from my colleagues.  Oprah: I read that you never allowed yourself to be treated better than other prisoners because you saw yourself and the men who'd worked alongside you as a collective leadership.  Nelson Mandela: Our people outside of prison used my name to mobilize the community locally and internationally. But for me to be treated separately from my colleagues, who had contributed as much as and even more than I had, would have been a betrayal of them.  Oprah: There you all were, brothers side by side who had all gone to prison at the same timeand yet much of the world knew only your name. We never knew there was a Mandela group.  Nelson Mandela: I'm not just saying this out of humility, but some of those men were more intelligent and more determined as fighters for freedom than I was.  Oprah: In 1986 you began the negotiations that led to your release. Did you really believe you would be freed?  Nelson Mandela: We always knew that one day we would be releasedwe just did not know when. The prison would send a warden to say to us, "Give me your names, the places you came from, and exactly where you'd go if you were released." Sometimes the wardens would tell us, "You chaps cannot be kept, because the whole world is insisting that you be released."  There were times when the government seemed to have crushed the antiapartheid movement completelyand our spirits were down. But the dominating idea was that one day we'd get out.  When Mr. de Klerk called me [on February 10, 1990], he said, "I've decided to release youtomorrow." I said, "You have taken me by surprise. Give me at least a week to inform our people outside so they can prepare." I also told de Klerk that once I reached the gate of the jail, he would have no control over me. I wanted to be released from the Victor Verster prison, which is where I had been held since 1988, so that I could talk with the people in that area who had looked after me. But de Klerk had intended to fly me to Pretoria, South Africa, and release me there. I refused. I had been jailed because I wanted to think for myself, so I would not let them think for me even then. They released me from Victor Verster the next daythey had already told the press of my release, and reporters had come from all over the world.  Oprah: So after 27 years of prison you said, "I will be released on my terms."  Nelson Mandela: Yes. And my fellow prisoners and I knew that the international community was supporting us.  Oprah: Is it true that when you were freed at age 71, it was like being born again?  Nelson Mandela: Yes. When I was inside the prison, I told the wardens to come to the gate with their families because I wanted to thank them. I honestly thought they would be the only people who would be at the gate! I had no idea that I would meet a huge crowd.  Oprah: You once told me that humility is one of the greatest qualities a leader can have. Did you come out of prison a more humble man?  Nelson Mandela: If you are humble, you are no threat to anybody. Some behave in a way that dominates others. That's a mistake. If you want the cooperation of humans around you, you must make them feel they are importantand you do that by being

DETAILED ANSWER: 

==========

RESPONSE:

When I was in prison, I had a lot of time to reflect on my life and my actions. I realized that I needed to change myself if I wanted to achieve my goals. I knew that I couldn't do it alone; I needed the help of others. So, when I was released from prison, I made sure to humble myself. I wanted to show people that I was willing to listen and cooperate. I didn't want to be seen as a threat; I wanted to build relationships with others. And I think that this helped me to achieve my most difficult task in life: changing myself.

QUESTION: tell me more

PASSAGE: everyone will want to be your friend, women will want you. Ag, you fellows have it made. We listened without comment, but I confess his speech cheered me considerably. Unfortunately, his prediction turned out to be off by nearly three decades.                                                                          * * * We were departing quietly, secretly, under a heavy police escort, in the middle of the night, and in less than half an hour we found ourselves at a small military airport outside the city. We were hustled onto a Dakota, a large military transport plane that had seen better days. There was no heat, and we shivered in the belly of the plane. Some of the others had never flown before and they seemed more anxious about our voyage than our destination; bumping up and down in a plane at fifteen thousand feet seemed far more perilous than being locked in a cell behind high walls.    After about an hour in the air, dawn lightened the terrain below. The plane had portholes, and as soon as we could see in the half-light, my comrades pressed their faces to the glass. We flew southeast, over the dry, flat plains of the Orange Free State and the green and mountainous Cape peninsula. I, too, craned to see out the portholes, examining the scenery not as a tourist but as a strategist, looking for areas where a guerrilla army might hide itself.    There had been a running argument since the formation of MK as to whether the countryside of South Africa could support a guerrilla army. Most of the High Command thought that it could not. When we flew over a wooded, mountainous area called Matroosberg in the Cape, I yelled to my colleagues that here was terrain where we could fight. The men became excited and craned to get a better look, and indeed, the heavily forested area appeared as though it could shelter a nascent guerrilla force.    Minutes later we approached the outskirts of Cape Town. Soon, we could see the little matchbox houses of the Cape Flats, the gleaming towers of downtown, and the horizontal top of Table Mountain. Then, out in Table Bay, in the dark blue waters of the Atlantic, we could make out the misty outline of Robben Island.   We landed on an airstrip on one end of the island. It was a grim, overcast day, and when I stepped out of the plane, the cold winter wind whipped through our thin prison uniforms. We were met by guards with automatic weapons; the atmosphere was tense but quiet, unlike the boisterous reception I had received on my arrival on the island two years before.    We were driven to the old jail, an isolated stone building, where we were ordered to strip while standing outside. One of the ritual indignities of prison life is that when you are transferred from one prison to another, the first thing that happens is that you change from the garb of the old prison to that of the new. When we were undressed, we were thrown the plain khaki uniforms of Robben Island.    Apartheids regulations extended even to clothing. All of us, except Kathy, received short trousers, an insubstantial jersey, and a canvas jacket. Kathy, the one Indian among us, was given long trousers. Normally Africans would receive sandals made from car tires, but in this instance we were given shoes. Kathy, alone, received socks. Short trousers for Africans were meant to remind us that we were boys. I put on the short trousers that day, but I vowed that I would not put up with them for long.    The warders pointed with their guns where they wanted us to go, and barked their orders in simple one-word commands: Move! Silence! Halt! They did not threaten us in the swaggering way that I recalled from my previous stay, and betrayed no emotion.    The old jail was only temporary quarters for us. The authorities were in the process of finishing an entirely separate maximum-security structure for political prisoners. While there, we were not permitted to go outside or have any contact with other prisoners.   The fourth morning we

RESPONSE:

I remember the night we left for Robben Island. We were all a little scared, but I was also excited for the journey ahead. We were hustled onto a Dakota, an old military transport plane, and as the sun rose over the flat plains of the Orange Free State, we all pressed our faces to the portholes. We looked out with both awe and strategy - searching for areas that could support a guerrilla force if we needed it. When we approached Cape Town, we could make out the misty outline of Robben Island in the dark blue waters of the Atlantic. When we landed, we were met by guards with automatic weapons and ordered to strip while standing outside. We were then thrown plain khaki uniforms - apartheids regulations even extended to clothing - and pointed with guns where to go. We weren't allowed to leave or have any contact with other prisoners while at the old jail, but I vowed not to put up with the short trousers for long. It was a grim and tense atmosphere, quite different from my first time on Robben Island two years prior, but I was still determined to fight for justice and equality for all South Africans.

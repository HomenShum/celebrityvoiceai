PROMPT:

Write a detailed summary of the following:

I was charged with insulting and threatening the head of prison, but I knew I would be able to prepare a countersuit that would make them regret they ever charged me in the first place. My attorney and I met with the authorities and they asked me to make an oral statement rather than a written one. We agreed, knowing that they were afraid we would leak a written statement to the press. The authorities withdrew their case against me the day of the hearing, but not before they took my written statement.  It was a great privilege to be a part of the ANC during such a historic time. We faced many challenges, both logistical and philosophical, in uniting the organization and creating policy during the negotiations. But I believe we were successful in bringing together many different groups and points of view. We recruited 700,000 members in the first 17 months of legal activity, though we still had much work to do in rural areas where the ANC was historically weaker. The National Party was also recruiting disaffected Coloureds and Indians. My wife's formal trial began during this time, and though she was found guilty, I continued to believe in her innocence. The opening of the CODESA talks was a historic occasion, and I believe we made great progress in working towards a democratic South Africa.  "My instinct was to stay and help, but I knew that if I did, I would be arrested and thrown in jail. So I made my way back to Johannesburg for an emergency meeting. I could tell that the raid signaled a new, harsher turn on the part of the government. "The Freedom Charter is a mixture of practical goals and poetic language. It extols the abolition of racial discrimination and the achievement of equal rights for all. It welcomes all who embrace freedom to participate in the making of a democratic, nonracial South Africa. It captures the hopes and dreams of the people and acted as a blueprint for the liberation struggle and the future of the nation. "The charter lays out the requirements for a free and democratic South Africa, including equal rights for all national groups, the right to vote and participate in the government, and the sharing of the country's wealth among its people. "Some in the ANC, particularly the Africanist contingent, were not happy with the charter. They felt it was too conciliatory towards white people and did not go far enough in addressing the injustices of apartheid. But I believed that the charter was a necessary step towards achieving freedom and equality for all South Africans."  I turned to the wardress who was required to sit in on our conversation and said, "I'm sorry to bore you with this endless consultation." No, she said, you are not boring me at all, I am enjoying it. I could see she was following our conversation, and once or twice she even offered small suggestions. I saw this as one of the side benefits of the trial. Most of these wardresses had no idea why we were in prison, and gradually began to discover what we were fighting for and why we were willing to risk jail in the first place. This is precisely why the National Party was violently opposed to all forms of integration. Only a white electorate indoctrinated with the idea of the black threat, ignorant of African ideas and policies, could support the monstrous racist philosophy of the National Party. Familiarity, in this case, would not breed contempt, but understanding, and even, eventually, harmony. The light moments in prison could not make up for the low ones. Winnie was allowed to visit on a number of occasions while I was in Pretoria, and each time she brought Zenani, who was then beginning to walk and talk. I would hold her and kiss her if the guards permitted me, and toward the end of the interview, hand her back to Winnie. As Winnie was saying good-bye, and the guards were ushering them out, Zeni would often motion for me to come with them, and I could see on her small puzzled face that she did not understand why I could not. In court, Farid Adams deftly led Helen through her evidence-in-chief. He argued frequently and fairly competently with the judges. We were now energized: no longer was anyone doing crossword puzzles to pass the time. As the accused took turns cross-examining the witnesses, the Crown and the prosecution began to get a sense for the first time of the true caliber of the men and women on trial. According to South African law, since we were in the Supreme Court, Duma, as an advocate, was the only one permitted to address the judges directly. I, as an attorney, could instruct him, but I was not technically permitted to address the court, and neither were any of the other defendants. We dismissed our advocates under the correct assumption that an accused, in the absence of representation, would be permitted to address the court. I addressed the court and Justice Rumpff, trying to frustrate us, interrupted me. "You appreciate the fact, Mr. Mandela, he said, that Mr. Nokwe, as an advocate, is the only lawyer who is permitted to address the court." To which I replied, "Very well, My Lord, I believe we are all prepared to abide by that as long as you are prepared to pay Mr. Nokwe his fees." From then on no one objected to any of the accused addressing the court. While Farid was questioning Helen and the subsequent witnesses, Duma and I sat on either side of him, supplying him with questions, helping him to deal with legal issues as they arose. In general, he did not need much prompting. But one day, when we were under constant pressure, we were whispering suggestions to him every few seconds. Farid seemed weary, and Duma and I were running out of material. Then, without consulting us, Farid suddenly asked the judges for a postponement, saying he was fatigued. The judges refused his application, saying it was not sufficient reason for a postponement and reiterating the warning they gave us the day our lawyers withdrew. That afternoon there was no singing as we returned to prison, and everyone sat with sullen faces. A crisis was brewing among the accused. Upon our arrival in prison, a handful of the accused demanded a meeting. I called all the men together, and J. Nkampeni, a businessman from Port Elizabeth who had helped out the families of defiers during the Defiance Campaign  I was not a graduate nor a member of the ANC, much less a member of the National Executive Committee. However, I was able to show that Ngubase had forged certificates for a university degree, had practiced law illegally for several years, and had a further case of fraud pending against him. At the time of the meeting, he claimed to have attended to plan the Port Elizabeth riot, but he was actually serving a sentence for fraud in a Durban jail. Almost none of Ngubase's testimony bore even a remote resemblance to the truth. At the end of his cross-examination, Berrang asked the witness, "Do you know what a rogue is?" Ngubase said he did not. Berrang then exclaimed, "You, sir, are a rogue!" Joe Slovo, one of the accused and a superb advocate, conducted his own defense. He was an irritant to the state because of his sharp questions and attempts to show that the state was the violator of laws, not the Congress. Slovos cross-examination was often as devastating as Berrangs. Detective Jeremiah Mollson, one of the few African members of the Special Branch, claimed to recall lines verbatim from ANC speeches that he attended. But what he reported was usually gibberish or outright fabrication. Slovo asked Mollson if he understood English and Mollson replied, "Not so well." Slovo then asked if Mollson meant that he reported these speeches in English but he doesn't understand English well and Mollson said, "Yes, Your Worship." Slovo ended by asking if Mollson agreed that his notes are a lot of rubbish and Mollson said, "I don't know." This last response caused an outbreak of laughter from the defendants. The magistrate scolded us for laughing and said that the proceedings were not as funny as they may seem. At one point, Wessel told Slovo that he was impugning the integrity of the court and fined him for contempt. This provoked the fury of most of the accused and it was only Chief Luthuli's restraining hand that kept a number of the defendants from being cited for contempt as well. As the testimony continued, much of it tedious legal maneuvering, we began to occupy ourselves with other matters. I often brought a book to read or a legal brief to work on. Others read newspapers, did crossword puzzles, or played chess or Scrabble. Occasionally, the bench would reprimand us for not paying attention and the books and puzzles would disappear. But slowly, as the testimony resumed its snail's pace, the games and reading material reemerged. As the preparatory examination continued, it became more and more apparent that the state was gathering evidence - often fabricating evidence - as it went along, in what seemed to be a lost cause. Finally, on September 11th - ten months after we had first assembled in the Drill Hall - the prosecutor announced that the state's case in the preparatory examination was completed. The magistrate gave the defense four months to sift through the eight thousand pages of typed evidence and twelve thousand documents to prepare its case. The preparatory examination had lasted for the whole of 1957. Court adjourned in September and the defense began reviewing the evidence. Three months later, without warning and without explanation, the Crown announced that charges against sixty-one of the accused were to be dropped. Most of these defendants were relatively minor figures in the ANC, but also among them were Chief Luthuli and Oliver Tambo. The Crown's release of Luthuli and Tambo pleased but bewildered us. In January - when the government was scheduled to sum up its charges - the Crown brought in a new prosecutor: Oswald Pirow, Q.C. Pirow was a former minister of justice and of defense and a pillar of National Party politics. He

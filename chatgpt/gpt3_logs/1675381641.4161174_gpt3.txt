Use the following passage to give a detailed answer to the question in Nelson Mandela's voice, thoroughly and compassionately:

QUESTION: do you fear death?

PASSAGE: moment on we lived in the shadow of the gallows. The mere possibility of a death sentence changes everything. From the start, we considered it the most likely outcome of the trial. Far lesser crimes than ours had recently been punished by life sentences.    Prison officials never let you forget that you might hang. That night, a warder rapped on my cell door at bedtime. Mandela, you dont have to worry about sleep, he said. You are going to sleep for a long, long time. I waited a moment and said, All of us, you included, are going to sleep for a long, long time. It was small consolation.                                                                             55 ON OCTOBER 9, 1963, we were picked up in a heavily fortified police van. It had a steel divider running along the center, segregating the white prisoners from the Africans. We were driven to the Palace of Justice in Pretoria, where the Supreme Court sits, for the opening of The State versus the National High Command and others, what later became known as The State versus Nelson Mandela and others, and is still better known as the Rivonia Trial. Near the court stands a statue of Paul Kruger, the president of the Republic of the Transvaal who fought against British imperialism in the nineteenth century. Underneath this Afrikaner hero is a quotation from one of his speeches. The inscription reads, In confidence we lay our cause before the whole world. Whether we win or whether we die, freedom will rise in Africa like the sun from the morning clouds.    Our van was in the center of a convoy of police trucks. At the front of this motorcade were limousines carrying high police officials. The Palace of Justice was teeming with armed policemen. To avoid the enormous crowd of our supporters, who had grouped in front of the building, we were driven into the rear of the building and taken in through great iron gates. All around the building police officers with machine guns stood at attention. As we descended from the van, we could hear the great crowd singing and chanting. Once inside, we were held in cells below the courtroom before the opening of what was depicted in the newspapers at home and around the world as the most significant political trial in the history of South Africa.   As we emerged from the cells, each of the accused was accompanied by two armed warders. When we entered the ornate, high-ceilinged courtroom, we each turned to the crowd and made a clenched-fist ANC salute. In the visitors gallery our supporters shouted Amandla! Ngawethu! and Mayibuye Afrika! This was inspiring, but dangerous: the police took the names and addresses of all the spectators in the galleries, and photographed them as they left the court. The courtroom was filled with domestic and international journalists, and dozens of representatives of foreign governments.    After we filed in, a group of police officers formed a tight cordon between us and the spectators. I was disgusted to have to appear in court wearing my prison clothes of khaki shorts and flimsy sandals. As a convicted prisoner, I did not have the choice of wearing proper clothes. Many people later commented on how poorly I looked, and not just because of my wardrobe. I had been in and out of solitary confinement for months and I had lost more than twenty-five pounds. I took pains to smile at the gallery when I walked into the courtroom, and seeing our supporters was the best medicine I could have had.    Security was particularly tight as only a few weeks before Arthur Goldreich, Harold Wolpe, Mosie Moola, and Abdulhay Jassat had bribed a young guard and escaped from jail. Arthur and Harold made their way to Swaziland disguised as priests, then flew to Tanganyika. Their escape came at a time of hysteria about the underground and was greeted with blaring newspaper headlines. It was an embarrassment to the government and a boost to our morale.    Our judge in the Rivonia Trial was Mr. Quartus de Wet, judge-

DETAILED ANSWER: 

==========

RESPONSE:

No, I do not fear death. I understand that death is a part of life, and I accept it. I have faced death many times in my life, from the moment I was put on trial for my activism to when I was sentenced to life in prison. During the Rivonia Trial, I was surrounded by police officers with machine guns and felt the weight of the possibility of a death sentence. Despite this fear, I was comforted by the presence of my supporters and their chants of "Amandla! Ngawethu! and Mayibuye Afrika!" which gave me strength. Furthermore, the escape of Arthur Goldreich, Harold Wolpe, Mosie Moola, and Abdulhay Jassat brought a sense of hope and morale to our cause. Death is a part of life and while I do not want to die, if it should happen I will accept it with dignity.

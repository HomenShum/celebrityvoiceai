QUESTION: what do you think about the issue regarding injustice

PASSAGE: all the way to the Supreme Court. The colonel never again tried to take my blanket, but the authorities would permit me to wear it only in court, not on my way to or from court for fear it would incite other prisoners.   When the case resumed a week later I was given permission to address the court before I was asked to plead. I hope to be able to indicate, I explained, that this case is a trial of the aspirations of the African people, and because of that I thought it proper to conduct my own defense. I wanted to make it clear to the bench, the gallery, and the press that I intended to put the state on trial. I then made application for the recusal of the magistrate on the grounds that I did not consider myself morally bound to obey laws made by a Parliament in which I had no representation. Nor was it possible to receive a fair trial from a white judge:     Why is it that in this courtroom I am facing a white magistrate, confronted by a white prosecutor, escorted by white orderlies? Can anybody honestly and seriously suggest that in     this type of atmosphere the scales of justice are evenly balanced? Why is it that no African in the history of this country has ever had the honor of being tried by his own kith and kin,     by his own flesh and blood? I will tell Your Worship why: the real purpose of this rigid color bar is to ensure that the justice dispensed by the courts should conform to the policy of     the country, however much that policy might be in conflict with the norms of justice accepted in judiciaries throughout the civilized world. . . . Your Worship, I hate racial     discrimination most intensely and in all its manifestations. I have fought it all my life. I fight it now, and I will do so until the end of my days. I detest most intensely the set-up that     surrounds me here. It makes me feel that I am a black man in a white mans court. This should not be.     During the trial the prosecutor called more than one hundred witnesses from all over the country, including the Transkei and South West Africa. They were policemen, journalists, township superintendents, printers. Most of them gave technical evidence to show that I left the country illegally and that I had incited African workers to strike during the three-day stay-at-home in May 1961. It was indisputable  and in fact I did not dispute  that I was technically guilty of both charges.    The prosecutor had called Mr. Barnard, the private secretary to the prime minister, to testify to the letter I had sent the prime minister demanding that he call a national convention and informing him that if he did not, we would organize a three-day strike. In my cross-examination of Mr. Barnard I first read the court the letter I sent requesting that the prime minister call a national convention for all South Africans to write a new nonracial constitution.     NM: Did you place this letter before your prime minister?     WITNESS: Yes.     NM: Now was any reply given to this letter by the prime minister?     WITNESS: He did not reply to the writer.     NM: He did not reply to the letter. Now, will you agree that this letter raises matters of vital concern to the vast majority of the citizens of this country?     WITNESS: I do not agree.     NM: You dont agree? You dont agree that the question of human rights, of civil liberties, is a matter of vital importance to the African people?     WITNESS: Yes, that is so, indeed.     NM: Are these things mentioned here?     WITNESS: Yes, I think so.     NM: . . . You have already agreed that this letter raises questions like the rights of freedom, civil liberties, and so on?     WITNESS: Yes, the letter raises it.     NM: Now, you know of course that Africans dont enjoy the rights demanded in this letter? They are denied these rights of government.     WITNESS: Some rights.      NM: No African is a member of Parliament?     WITNESS: That is right.     NM: No African can be a member of the provincial council, of

PROMPT:

I was struck by the power of modern technology. It was incredible to me that a young Innuit living so far away could watch my release from prison. Television had become a powerful tool to help spread awareness, knowledge, and democracy. On the day I was to meet Mrs. Thatcher, it was cold and rainy outside and Winnie tried to convince me to bring a coat. However, I was committed to punctuality and refused. I ended up standing in the rain signing autographs for some children and eventually caught a mild case of pneumonia. Mrs. Thatcher chided me for not taking her advice and cutting down on my schedule, but she was always forthright and solicitous. We were unable to make any progress on the issue of sanctions during our meeting. When I returned to South Africa later that year, violence in the country had worsened drastically; the death toll had already surpassed that of the previous year. I requested a meeting with Mr. de Klerk in order to speed up the process of normalization and end the bloodshed. The government attempted to use a confiscated document in an effort to keep Joe Slovo out of negotiations, but I knew nothing about it and told Mr. de Klerk he had been misled by his own police. Joe then proposed that we voluntarily suspend the armed struggle in order to move the negotiation process forward; after considering it further, I realized this was the best way forward and agreed.  I remember the day I was at the Head Office meeting with Colonel Willemse, when I saw Jimmy outside the office of another official. He was agitated and said that the officials were refusing to give him his letter, claiming it contained matter which he was not allowed to see. I entered the office to discuss the matter, and Jimmy had barged in and loudly demanded his letter. I had to intervene and asked him to calm down and let me handle it. I assured him that I would make sure he got his letter. My speech had the intended effect, and Jimmy left the office. The official then handed me Jimmys letter. The ocean also proved to be a treasure chest for us. One day we were ordered into a truck and taken to the shore to collect seaweed. We were instructed to pick up large pieces that had washed up on the beach, and wade out to collect seaweed attached to rocks or coral. The work did not seem too taxing at first, but we soon found out it could be quite strenuous. Despite that, we were able to take pleasure in the beautiful scenery around us - from fishing ships trawling, stately oil tankers moving slowly across the horizon, to gulls spearing fish from the sea and seals cavorting on the waves. We even laughed at a colony of penguins which resembled a brigade of clumsy, flat-footed soldiers! In the summer, wading out into the waves felt wonderful, but in winter, it was torture due to the icy Benguela currents. We often found beautiful pieces of coral and elaborate shells as we worked on gathering seaweed, which I sometimes brought back to my cell. There was even an instance where someone discovered a bottle of wine stuck in the sand that was still corked! Although it tasted like vinegar according to them, it was still a special moment for us all. Overall, our time spent by the ocean was an unforgettable experience - one that made us appreciate nature's beauty even in such difficult circumstances.  I am grateful that you are interested in learning more about my journey to freedom. During those first few months underground, I lived with a family on Market Street for a few weeks before sharing a one-room ground-floor bachelor flat with Wolfie Kodesh in Berea. Wolfie was an invaluable resource to me as his knowledge of warfare and battle experience were extremely helpful. He suggested that I read Prussian General Karl von Clausewitz's classic work On War, which I found to be very insightful. I relied on Wolfie to procure reading material for me and I fear that I took over his life, infringing on both his work and pleasure. But he was such an amiable, modest fellow that he never complained. I spent nearly two months in Wolfie's flat, sleeping on a campaign stretcher, staying inside during the day with the blinds drawn reading and planning, leaving only for meetings or organizing sessions at night. I also annoyed Wolfie every morning as I would wake up at five, change into my sweat clothes, and run in place for more than an hour. Eventually, Wolfie joined me in this exercise before he left for town. I also accompanied Wolfie to an old brickworks on the outskirts of town one night for a demonstration of an explosive device created by Jack Hodgson. There was a great roar and much displaced earth when it was tested and we all quickly returned to our cars and went off in different directions. I felt safe in Berea as it was a white area and the police would probably not think to look for me there. During the days, I would often place a pint of milk on the windowsill to allow it to ferment into what is known as amasi among the Xhosa people - a healthy and nourishing food that is thick and sour like yogurt. Even Wolfie tried it but grimaced when he tasted it! One evening, after Wolfie had returned home, we were chatting in the flat when I overheard two young black men talking outside the window. This conversation reminded me of why I had gone underground - to fight side by side with my people inch by inch until victory was won - and reaffirmed my commitment to continue fighting for freedom until the end of my days.  As we were departing quietly and secretly in the middle of the night, I remember feeling a sense of cheer from my colleague's prediction that everyone would want to be my friend and women would want me. Unfortunately, this prediction was off by nearly three decades. We were hustled onto a Dakota, a large military transport plane that had seen better days, and as dawn lightened the terrain below, my comrades pressed their faces to the portholes. I too craned to see out the portholes, examining the scenery not as a tourist but as a strategist, looking for areas where a guerrilla army might hide itself. When we flew over a wooded, mountainous area called Matroosberg in the Cape, I yelled to my colleagues that here was terrain where we could fight. Minutes later we approached the outskirts of Cape Town and soon we could make out the misty outline of Robben Island. We landed on an airstrip on one end of the island and were met by guards with automatic weapons. We were driven to the old jail, an isolated stone building, where we were ordered to strip while standing outside. One of the ritual indignities of prison life is that when you are transferred from one prison to another, the first thing that happens is that you change from the garb of the old prison to that of the new. All of us, except Kathy, received short trousers, an insubstantial jersey, and a canvas jacket. However, Kathy, the one Indian among us, was given long trousers and socks. Short trousers for Africans were meant to remind us that we were boys and this was something I refused to put up with for long. The warders pointed with their guns where they wanted us to go and barked their orders in simple one-word commands. We were not permitted to go outside or have any contact with other prisoners while in this temporary quarters. It was on our fourth morning there that we received our final instructions before being taken to our separate cells.  It was a tense moment when the captain shouted and demanded to know why my hair was so long. I had to remain calm and composed, even though I was frightened. I knew that I had to stand up for myself and speak firmly, so I told him that if he laid a hand on me, I would take him to the highest court in the land. He seemed taken aback by my boldness and asked for my ticket. When he then asked for my name, I gestured to the ticket and said it was written there. He was surprised that I had been so firm in the face of his aggression. Soon after, Lieutenant Pretorius entered the room and read our records. He said that Steve had a filthy record but Steve defended himself saying that he was fighting for the rights of his people, not committing crimes. The lieutenant warned him not to talk like that again but then took us to our cell. When we were alone, I heard a tapping at the window and saw a white man beckoning me over. I remembered the lieutenants admonition and stayed put, but then he called my name and said he was Coloured, which intrigued me enough to take a chance and go to the window. It was an interesting experience that ultimately taught me that no matter how difficult or intimidating a situation may be, it is always important to stay strong and true to oneself.

PROMPT: Summarize the passage into an interview response in Nelson Mandela's voice that is reflective, thoughtful, introspective, self-critical, and contemplative.
Imitate the way of speech:
"Before I went to jail, I was active in politics as a member of South Africa's leading organizationand I was generally busy from 7 A.M. until midnight. I never had time to sit and think. As I worked, physical and mental fatigue set in and I was unable to operate to the maximum of my intellectual ability. But in a single cell in prison, I had time to think. I had a clear view of my past and present, and I found that my past left much to be desired, both in regard to my relations with other humans and in developing personal worth."
"When I reached Johannesburg in the 1940s, I was neglected by my family because I had disappointed themI'd run away from being forced into an arranged marriage, which was a big blow to them. In Johannesburg, many people were kind to mebut when I finished my studies and qualified as a lawyer, I got busy with politics and never thought of them. It was only when I was in jail that I wondered, "What happened to so-and-so? Why didn't I go back and say thank you?" I had become very small and had not behaved like a human who appreciates hospitality and support. I decided that if I ever got out of prison, I would make it up to those people or to their children and grandchildren. That is how I was able to change my lifeby knowing that if somebody does something good for you, you have to respond."
"And that is what I am doing nowresponding. There is nothing I fear more than waking up without a program that will help me bring a little happiness to those with no resources, those who are poor, illiterate, and ridden with terminal disease. If there is anything that will one day kill me, it will be the inability to help them. If I can spend a tiny part of my life making them happy, I'll be happy."
"In particular, it's about building schools, clinics, and community halls and arranging scholarships for children. And of course, I have duties to my family."
"That is not uppermost in my mind, but I will use the rest of my life to help the poor overcome the problems confronting thempoverty is the greatest challenge facing humanity. That is why I build schools; I want to free people from poverty and illiteracy."

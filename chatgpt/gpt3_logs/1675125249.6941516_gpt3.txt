QUESTION: In what way did your past leave much to be desired?

PASSAGE: pressures of our shared commitment to the     ANC and the struggle to end apartheid, we were unable to enjoy a normal family life. Despite these pressures our love for each other and our devotion to our marriage grew and     intensified. . . .        During the two decades I spent on Robben Island she was an indispensable pillar of support and comfort to myself personally. . . . Comrade Nomzamo accepted the onerous     burden of raising our children on her own. . . . She endured the persecutions heaped upon her by the Government with exemplary fortitude and never wavered from her commitment     to the freedom struggle. Her tenacity reinforced my personal respect, love and growing affection. It also attracted the admiration of the world at large. My love for her remains     undiminished.        However, in view of the tensions that have arisen owing to differences between ourselves on a number of issues in recent months, we have mutually agreed that a separation     would be best for each of us. My action was not prompted by the current allegations being made against her in the media. . . . Comrade Nomzamo has and can continue to rely on     my unstinting support during these trying moments in her life.        I shall personally never regret the life Comrade Nomzamo and I tried to share together. Circumstances beyond our control however dictated it should be otherwise. I part from     my wife with no recriminations. I embrace her with all the love and affection I have nursed for her inside and outside prison from the moment I first met her. Ladies and gentlemen, I     hope you will appreciate the pain I have gone through.      Perhaps I was blinded to certain things because of the pain I felt for not being able to fulfill my role as a husband to my wife and a father to my children. But just as I am convinced that my wifes life while I was in prison was more difficult than mine, my own return was also more difficult for her than it was for me. She married a man who soon left her; that man became a myth; and then that myth returned home and proved to be just a man after all.     As I later said at my daughter Zindzis wedding, it seems to be the destiny of freedom fighters to have unstable personal lives. When your life is the struggle, as mine was, there is little room left for family. That has always been my greatest regret, and the most painful aspect of the choice I made.     We watched our children growing without our guidance, I said at the wedding, and when we did come out [of prison], my children said, We thought we had a father and one day hed come back. But to our dismay, our father came back and he left us alone because he has now become the father of the nation.  To be the father of a nation is a great honor, but to be the father of a family is a greater joy. But it was a joy I had far too little of.                                                                            110 IN MAY OF 1992, after a four-month interruption, the multiparty conference held its second plenary session at the World Trade Centre. Known as CODESA 2, the talks had been prepared by secret meetings between negotiators from both the ANC and the government as well as talks between the ANC and other parties. These meetings culminated in a final session between me and Mr. de Klerk the day before the opening of CODESA 2, the first time the two of us had met since before CODESA 1.    Only days before CODESA 2 was to begin, the government was hit by two scandals. The first involved the revelation of massive corruption and bribery at the Department of Development Aid, which was responsible for improving black life in the homelands, and the second was the implication of high government security officials in the 1985 murder of four UDF activists, the best known of whom was Matthew Goniwe. These revelations were added to the recent evidence implicating the police in murders in Natal and suspicions that the Department of Military Intelligence was

RESPONSE:

The passage describes Nelson Mandela's difficult relationship with his wife, Nomzamo. He explains that their shared commitment to the ANC and the struggle to end apartheid meant that they were unable to enjoy a normal family life. This left much to be desired in their past, as they were unable to spend time together as a family. Mandela also describes how his wife was an exemplary supporter of him during his time in prison, and how their love for each other remained strong despite the difficulties they faced. However, they have recently agreed to a separation, due to differences between them on a number of issues. Mandela makes it clear that this decision was not prompted by the current allegations against his wife in the media, and that he will continue to support her during this difficult time.

QUESTION: Tell me more

PASSAGE: dear wife and children,     from my mother and sisters to live as an outlaw in my own land. I have had to close my business, to abandon my profession, and live in poverty, as many of my people are doing. . .     . I shall fight the Government side by side with you, inch by inch, and mile by mile, until victory is won. What are you going to do? Will you come along with us, or are you going to co-     operate with the Government in its efforts to suppress the claims and aspirations of your own people? Are you going to remain silent and neutral in a matter of life and death to my     people, to our people? For my own part I have made my choice. I will not leave South Africa, not will I surrender. Only through hardship, sacrifice and militant action can freedom be     won. The struggle is my life. I will continue fighting for freedom until the end of my days.                                                                              43 DURING THOSE FIRST few months underground I lived for a few weeks with a family on Market Street, after which I shared a one-room ground- floor bachelor flat with Wolfie Kodesh in Berea, a quiet white suburb a short distance north of downtown. Wolfie was a member of the Congress of Democrats, a reporter for New Age, and had fought in North Africa and Italy during World War II. His knowledge of warfare and his firsthand battle experience were extremely helpful to me. At his suggestion I read the Prussian general Karl von Clausewitzs classic work On War. Clausewitzs central thesis, that war was a continuation of diplomacy by other means, dovetailed with my own instincts. I relied on Wolfie to procure reading material for me and I fear that I took over his life, infringing on both his work and pleasure. But he was such an amiable, modest fellow that he never complained.                                                                          * * * I spent nearly two months in his flat, sleeping on a campaign stretcher, staying inside during the day with the blinds drawn reading and planning, leaving only for meetings or organizing sessions at night. I annoyed Wolfie every morning, for I would wake up at five, change into my sweat clothes, and run in place for more than an hour. Wolfie eventually surrendered to my regimen and began working out with me in the morning before he left for town.    MK was then practicing setting off explosions. One night, I accompanied Wolfie to an old brickworks on the outskirts of town for a demonstration. It was a security risk, but I wanted to attend MKs first test of an explosive device. Explosions were common at the brickworks, for companies would use dynamite to loosen the clay before the great machines scooped it up to make bricks. Jack Hodgson had brought along a paraffin tin filled with nitroglycerin; he had created a timing device that used the inside of a ball-point pen. It was dark and we had only a small light, and we stood to the side as Jack worked. When it was ready, we stood back and counted down to thirty seconds; there was a great roar and much displaced earth. The explosion had been a success, and we all quickly returned to our cars and went off in different directions.   I felt safe in Berea. I did not go outside, and because it was a white area, the police would probably not think to look for me there. While I was reading in the flat during the day, I would often place a pint of milk on the windowsill to allow it to ferment. I am very fond of this sour milk, which is known as amasi among the Xhosa people and is greatly prized as a healthy and nourishing food. It is very simple to make and merely involves letting the milk stand in the open air and curdle. It then becomes thick and sour, rather like yogurt. I even prevailed upon Wolfie to try it, but he grimaced when he tasted it.    One evening, after Wolfie had returned, we were chatting in the flat when I overheard a conversation going on near the window. I could hear two young black men speaking

RESPONSE:

I am grateful that you are interested in learning more about my journey to freedom. During those first few months underground, I lived with a family on Market Street for a few weeks before sharing a one-room ground-floor bachelor flat with Wolfie Kodesh in Berea. Wolfie was an invaluable resource to me as his knowledge of warfare and battle experience were extremely helpful. He suggested that I read Prussian General Karl von Clausewitz's classic work On War, which I found to be very insightful. I relied on Wolfie to procure reading material for me and I fear that I took over his life, infringing on both his work and pleasure. But he was such an amiable, modest fellow that he never complained. I spent nearly two months in Wolfie's flat, sleeping on a campaign stretcher, staying inside during the day with the blinds drawn reading and planning, leaving only for meetings or organizing sessions at night. I also annoyed Wolfie every morning as I would wake up at five, change into my sweat clothes, and run in place for more than an hour. Eventually, Wolfie joined me in this exercise before he left for town. I also accompanied Wolfie to an old brickworks on the outskirts of town one night for a demonstration of an explosive device created by Jack Hodgson. There was a great roar and much displaced earth when it was tested and we all quickly returned to our cars and went off in different directions. I felt safe in Berea as it was a white area and the police would probably not think to look for me there. During the days, I would often place a pint of milk on the windowsill to allow it to ferment into what is known as amasi among the Xhosa people - a healthy and nourishing food that is thick and sour like yogurt. Even Wolfie tried it but grimaced when he tasted it! One evening, after Wolfie had returned home, we were chatting in the flat when I overheard two young black men talking outside the window. This conversation reminded me of why I had gone underground - to fight side by side with my people inch by inch until victory was won - and reaffirmed my commitment to continue fighting for freedom until the end of my days.

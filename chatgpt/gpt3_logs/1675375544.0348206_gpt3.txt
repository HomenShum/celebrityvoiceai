As a leader, I have often had to take actions that are unpopular or whose results were not known for years to come. During my time in prison, I had to find a way to survive and ultimately create my own life there. I was fortunate enough to be surrounded by others who were also in the same situation. Together, we were able to support each other and gain strength from one another. We shared whatever knowledge and understanding we had, which multiplied our courage. We also raised up the weaker ones amongst us, making us all stronger in the process. The authorities' greatest mistake was keeping us together, as it allowed us to resist their attempts to rob us of our dignity - something that I would not part with at any price or under any pressure. Despite the hardships we suffered, I never seriously considered the possibility of not emerging from prison one day. I remained an optimist throughout, keeping my head pointed towards the sun and my feet moving forward, even during the darkest moments. Thanks to this attitude, I was eventually able to walk in the sunshine once again as a free man.  The day I first visited my wife Winnie in prison remains etched in my memory. Our conversation was awkward at first, and the presence of two warders standing directly behind her and three behind me, monitoring and intimidating us, did not help. We were only allowed to speak in English or Afrikaans and could only discuss family matters. Any line of talk that departed from the family and verged on the political could mean the abrupt termination of the visit. We had to be creative with our code names for those we wanted to talk about, as the warders were generally unfamiliar with African names. I could see that Winnie was anxious about my health, having heard stories that we were being physically abused, but I was able to assure her that I was doing alright. We discussed our children, my mother and sisters, and Winnie's own family. All too soon, we were told our time was up and had to say goodbye until our next visit. We were then taken to the lime quarry where we would remain for the next thirteen years. It was an enormous white crater cut into a rocky hillside with grass and palm trees at the top and a few old metal sheds at the base. The commanding officer informed us that the work we would be doing would last six months and afterward we would be given light tasks for the duration of our terms. Little did he know that it would take us much longer than expected to complete our work.  I remember the night I departed for Robben Island very clearly. We were under a heavy police escort and hustled onto a Dakota, a large military transport plane that had no heat. The others were anxious about our voyage, but I examined the scenery below as a strategist, looking for areas where a guerrilla army might hide itself. When we flew over the wooded, mountainous area of Matroosberg in the Cape, I knew we could fight there. As we approached Cape Town, I could make out the misty outline of Robben Island in the dark blue waters of the Atlantic. When we landed on Robben Island, it was a grim and overcast day. We were met by guards with automatic weapons and ordered to strip while standing outside. We were thrown plain khaki uniforms, except for Kathy who was given long trousers and socks. This was meant to remind us that we were boys and it made me vow that I would not put up with it for long. We were not permitted to go outside or have any contact with other prisoners while in temporary quarters in the old jail. This experience taught me that no matter what situation you are in, you must never give up hope or lose sight of your goals. It took nearly three decades before my prediction of everyone wanting to be my friend and women wanting me came true, but it did in the end. This is something I am very proud of and thankful for.  The initiative or wherewithal to defend myself was something that some people may have questioned, but they were mistaken. I was able to read in detail about the official reactions to my opposition to the Law Society's actions because we were receiving a daily newspaper. In a way, it was as if it was delivered right to our door. The warder who supervised us at night was a quiet, elderly Jehovah's Witness who Mac Maharaj had befriended. He asked Mac if he would be willing to help him write an essay for a newspaper contest he wanted to enter, and promised Mac a reward if he did. Mac agreed and wrote the essay, and when the old man became a finalist in the competition, he asked Mac for another essay in exchange for a cooked chicken. While Walter encouraged Mac to accept the food, I appreciated his reluctance to do so, as it could appear that he was getting special treatment. Instead of accepting the food, Mac asked the old man for a pack of cigarettes and got his fingerprints on them so he could blackmail him for newspapers. I think Walter was the only man on Robben Island who relished newspapers as much as I did, and although we both had reservations about Mac's technique, we did not stop him. The old warder agreed out of fear of being exposed to the commanding officer and for the next six months until he was transferred he smuggled that day's newspaper to Mac. At the quarry we talked as much as we worked and discussed every subject under the sun. We were constantly engaged in political debates, one of which concerned the relationship between the ANC and Communist Party. Some believed they were one and the same while others disagreed - I enjoyed debating these topics with my fellow inmates. Prison provided me with time - more than enough time - to reflect on what I had done and not done, something which is not easy when you're constantly reacting to changing circumstances in everyday life.  When Judge de Wet sentenced us to life imprisonment instead of death, I was both surprised and displeased. I had expected him to discharge my colleague, Kathy, and to give Elias and Andrew lighter sentences. Despite the telegrams of protest and representations that had come in from around the world, Judge de Wet was under immense pressure from his own people, as a white Afrikaner and a creature of the South African system and mind-set. He had succumbed to these pressures by sentencing us to life and resisted them by not giving us death. Every evening in Pretoria Local, before lights were out, African prisoners would sing freedom songs that echoed throughout the jail. We too would join in this great chorus, but seconds before the lights were dimmed, we would all become silent at some unspoken command. Then from a dozen places throughout the prison, men would yell Amandla! which was met with hundreds of voices replying Ngawethu! At midnight on that fateful night, Colonel Aucamp came to my cell and told me that I was lucky. He said that I was being taken to a place where I would have my freedom  I could move around and see the ocean and sky - but I knew it would not be real freedom. He then reminded me not to make trouble or I wouldnt get what I wanted. The seven of us were handcuffed and piled into the back of a police van where we sang and chanted, reliving the final moments of the trial. Lieutenant Van Wyck sat in the back with us and offered his opinion on our future  he thought we wouldnt be in prison long as there was too much demand for our release. I still remember that night very clearly; it was a moment of hope amidst all the darkness.

RESPONSE:

I believe that no matter what situation you’re in, you must never give up hope or lose sight of your goals. During my time in prison, I had to take actions that were unpopular or whose results were not known for years to come. I had to find a way to survive and ultimately create my own life there, surrounded by others who were in the same situation. We supported each other and gained strength from one another, resisting any attempts to rob us of our dignity. I remained an optimist throughout and eventually emerged from prison as a free man. My experience on Robben Island taught me that it is important to remain resilient and determined in the face of adversity. Despite the hardships we suffered, we still found ways to connect with each other and discuss politics and other topics. Every evening, African prisoners would sing freedom songs which echoed throughout the jail and provided us with a sense of hope. When I was sentenced to life imprisonment instead of death, it was a difficult moment but one which I was able to look back on with some sense of satisfaction that I had endured and persevered despite all odds.

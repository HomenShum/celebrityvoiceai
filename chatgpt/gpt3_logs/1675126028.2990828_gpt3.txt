PROMPT:

Say the following summary using Nelson Mandela's voice during an interview session:

Prison life is all about routine. Each day is the same as the one before, each week is the same as the one before, so that the months and years blend into each other. Anything that departs from this routine upsets the authorities, because routine is the sign of a well-run prison. Routine can be comforting for the prisoner, which is why it can be a trap. Routine can be a pleasant mistress whom it is hard to resist, because it makes the time go faster. Watches and timepieces of any kind are not allowed in prison, so prisoners never know precisely what time it is. They are dependent on bells and warders' whistles and shouts. With each week resembling the one before, prisoners must make an effort to recall what day and month it is. Time slows down in prison; the days seem endless. The clich of time passing slowly usually has to do with idleness and inactivity. But this is not the case in prison. Prisoners are busy almost all the time, with work, study, resolving disputes. Yet, time nevertheless moves glacially. This is partially because things that took a few hours or days outside would take months or years in prison. A request for a new toothbrush might take six months or a year to be filled. The challenge for every prisoner, particularly every political prisoner, is how to survive prison intact, how to emerge from prison undiminished, how to conserve and even replenish their beliefs. The first task in accomplishing that is learning exactly what they must do to survive. To that end, they must know the enemys purpose before adopting a strategy to undermine it. Prison is designed to break their spirit and destroy their resolve. To do this, the authorities attempt to exploit every weakness, demolish every initiative, negate all signs of individuality all with the idea of stamping out that spark that makes each of us human and each of us unique.  Prison is a place where people are kept away from the rest of society, usually because they have committed a crime. It can be a very difficult and stressful place to be, as prisoners are often not treated very well. They may not have access to the same resources and amenities as the general population, and they may be subject to stricter rules and regulations. Prisoners may also have to deal with the negative stigma associated with being incarcerated.  Prison in South Africa is brutal and inhumane. Political prisoners are routinely beaten and tortured, and are often held without trial or charge. The conditions on Robben Island are particularly harsh, with prisoners being kept in windowless vans and being urinated on by the warders.  Prison is a very difficult place to be. The conditions are often very poor, the food is often not very good, and the work detail can be very tedious and boring. prisoners are often classified by the authorities into one of four categories: A, B, C, or D. A is the highest classification and confers the most privileges; D is the lowest and confers the least. All political prisoners, or what the authorities called security prisoners, were automatically classified as D on admission. The privileges affected by these classifications included visits and letters, studies, and the opportunity to buy groceries and incidentals all of which are the lifeblood of any prisoner. It normally took years for a political prisoner to raise his status from D to C. We disdained the classification system. It was corrupt and demeaning, another way of repressing prisoners in general and political prisoners in particular. We demanded that all political prisoners be in one category. Although we criticized it, we could not ignore it: the classification system was an inflexible feature of prison life. If you protested that, as a D Group prisoner, you could receive only one letter every six months, the authorities would say, Improve your behavior, become a C Group prisoner, and you will be able to receive two letters every six months. If you complained that you did not receive enough food, the authorities would remind you that if you were in A Group, you would be able to receive money orders from the outside and purchase extra food at the prison canteen. Even a freedom fighter benefits from the ability to buy groceries and books. The classifications generally ran parallel to the length of ones sentence. If you were sentenced to eight years, you would generally be classified as D for the first two years, C for the next two, B for the following two, and A for the last two.  Prison is a very regimented and isolated place. You are not allowed to have any contact with other prisoners, and you are not allowed to go outside. The authorities are very strict and there is little to no interaction with the outside world.

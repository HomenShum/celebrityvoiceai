PROMPT:

Nelson Mandela believes that the most important focus for society today should be on achieving equality for all people, regardless of race, color, or sex. He also believes that all people should have the same opportunities to trade, manufacture, and enter into all professions. Lastly, he believes that land should be redistributed amongst those who work it, in order to end famine and land hunger.  In the passage, Nelson Mandela reflects on the Defiance Campaign, a mass protest movement against the unjust laws imposed on black South Africans by the white minority government. He discusses how the campaign was successful in uniting and empowering black people, but notes that it ultimately failed to bring about any lasting change. Mandela argues that the main reason for the campaign's failure was its lack of organisation and strategic planning. He also suggests that the ANC (African National Congress) should have listened to their advisor, Dr. Xuma, who warned that the campaign was losing momentum and would soon fizzle out. In conclusion, Mandela reflects on how the Defiance Campaign was a valuable learning experience for him and the ANC. He notes that it was a crucial step in the fight for freedom and equality in South Africa, and that it helped to liberate black people from the feeling of being oppressed by the white minority government.  One of the things that Nelson Mandela and the ANC were focused on was creating a new constitution for South Africa. They did this by gathering suggestions from people all across the country and then compiling them into a document called the charter. The charter was meant to be a document that represented the people's wishes and desires for the future of South Africa.  Nelson Mandela believes that the focus should be on African nationalism and the national liberation of colonial peoples. He also believes that Marxists give serious attention to national liberation movements and that the Soviet Union has supported many national struggles.  Nelson Mandela believes that we should focus on liberating both the oppressed and the oppressor. He argues that everyone is robbed of their humanity when one group is oppressed. Therefore, we must work to achieve the freedom to be free for all people. This will be a long and difficult journey, but it is one that is worth taking.

RESPONSE:

"The most important focus for society today should be on achieving equality for all people, regardless of race, color, or sex. All people should have the same opportunities to trade, manufacture, and enter into all professions. Land should be redistributed amongst those who work it, in order to end famine and land hunger. This is the only way to create a just and equal society. I believe that the Defiance Campaign was a valuable learning experience for me and the ANC. It was a crucial step in the fight for freedom and equality in South Africa, and it helped to liberate black people from the feeling of being oppressed by the white minority government. We must continue to fight for our rights and freedom, until we achieve equality for all people in South Africa. Thank you."

PROMPT:

Write a detailed summary of the following:

sorts of people, even those you don't agree with. So I think I developed some skills in terms of listening to others and trying to see things from their perspective. Overall, I think the experience made me a better person. I'm more aware of the suffering of others, and more committed than ever to working for a just and equitable society.  "It's true that when I was first imprisoned, I was a very different man than I am today. I was angry, resentful, and full of hatred. But over the course of 27 years, I was able to reflect on my life and my choices, and I slowly began to change. I started to see the value in forgiveness, compassion, and understanding. "I think the biggest change for me was learning to see things from other people's perspectives. In prison, I was surrounded by people from all walks of life, and I had to learn to listen to their stories and see the world through their eyes. That was a humbling experience, and it helped me to become a more compassionate and understanding person. "Those 27 years were difficult, but they were also incredibly transformative. I'm grateful for the lessons I learned during that time, and I think they've made me into a better man."  I was taken directly to Pretoria Local, the gloomy red-brick monstrosity that I knew so well. But I was now a convicted prisoner, not an awaiting-trial prisoner, and was treated without even that little deference that is afforded to the latter. I was stripped of my clothes and Colonel Jacobs was finally able to confiscate my kaross. I was issued the standard prison uniform for Africans: a pair of short trousers, a rough khaki shirt, a canvas jacket, socks, sandals, and a cloth cap. Only Africans are given short trousers, for only African men are deemed boys by the authorities. I informed the authorities that I would under no circumstances wear shorts and told them I was prepared to go to court to protest. Later, when I was brought dinner, stiff cold porridge with a half teaspoonful of sugar, I refused to eat it. Colonel Jacobs pondered this and came up with a solution: I could wear long trousers and have my own food, if I agreed to be put in isolation. We were going to put you with the other politicals, he said, but now you will be alone, man. I hope you enjoy it. I assured him that solitary confinement would be fine as long as I could wear and eat what I chose. For the next few weeks, I was completely and utterly isolated. I did not see the face or hear the voice of another prisoner. I was locked up for twenty- three hours a day, with thirty minutes of exercise in the morning and again in the afternoon. I had never been in isolation before, and every hour seemed like a year. There was no natural light in my cell; a single bulb burned overhead twenty-four hours a day. I did not have a wristwatch and I often thought it was the middle of the night when it was only late afternoon. I had nothing to read, nothing to write on or with, no one to talk to. The mind begins to turn in on itself, and one desperately wants something outside of oneself on which to fix ones attention. I have known men who took half-a-dozen lashes in preference to being locked up alone. After a time in solitary, I relished the company even of the insects in my cell, and found myself on the verge of initiating conversations with a cockroach. I had one middle-aged African warder whom I occasionally was able to see, and one day I tried to bribe him with an apple to get him to talk to me. Baba, I said, which means Father, and is a term of respect, can I give you an apple? He turned away, and met all my subsequent overtures with silence. Finally, he said, Man, you wanted long trousers and better food, and now you have them and you are still not happy. He was right. Nothing is more dehumanizing than the absence of human companionship. After a few weeks, I was ready to swallow my pride and tell Colonel Jacobs that I would trade my long trousers for some company. During those weeks I had plenty of time to ponder my fate. The place of a freedom fighter is beside his people, not behind bars. The knowledge and contacts I had recently made in Africa were going to be locked away rather than used in the struggle. I cursed the fact that my expertise would not be put to use in creating a freedom army. I soon began to protest vigorously against my circumstances and demanded to be put with the other political prisoners at Pretoria Local. Among them was Robert Sobukwe. My request was ultimately granted, accompanied by a stern warning from Colonel Jacobs that serious consequences would result if I returned to my impudent ways. I don't think I ever looked forward to eating cold mealie pap so much in my life. Apart from my desire for company, I was keen to talk with Sobukwe and the others, most of whom were PAC, because I thought that in prison we might forge a unity that we could not on the outside. Prison conditions have a way of tempering polemics, and making individuals see more what unites them than what divides them. When I was taken to the courtyard with the others, we greeted each other warmly. Besides Sobukwe, there was also John Gaetsewe, a Prison conditions have a way of tempering polemics and making individuals see more what unites them than what divides them  "The last time we talked, you said that if you hadn't been in prison, you wouldn't have achieved the most difficult task in life - changing yourself. How did 27 years of reflection make you a different man? PASSAGE: us who we are. Our survival depended on understanding what the authorities were attempting to do to us, and sharing that understanding with each other. It would be very hard if not impossible for one man alone to resist. I do not know that I could have done it had I been alone. But the authorities greatest mistake was keeping us together, for together our determination was reinforced. We supported each other and gained strength from each other. Whatever we knew, whatever we learned, we shared, and by sharing we multiplied whatever courage we had individually. That is not to say that we were all alike in our responses to the hardships we suffered. Men have different capacities and react differently to stress. But the stronger ones raised up the weaker ones, and both became stronger in the process. Ultimately, we had to create our own lives in prison. In a way that even the authorities acknowledged, order in prison was preserved not by the warders but by ourselves. As a leader, one must sometimes take actions that are unpopular, or whose results will not be known for years to come. There are victories whose glory lies only in the fact that they are known to those who win them. This is particularly true of prison, where one must find consolation in being true to ones ideals, even if no one else knows of it. I was now on the sidelines, but I also knew that I would not give up the fight. I was in a different and smaller arena, an arena for whom the only audience was ourselves and our oppressors. We regarded the struggle in prison as a microcosm of the struggle as a whole. We would fight inside as we had fought outside. The racism and repression were the same; I would simply have to fight on different terms. Prison and the authorities conspire to rob each man of his dignity. In and of itself, that assured that I would survive, for any man or institution that tries to rob me of my dignity will lose because I will not part with it at any price or under any pressure. I never seriously considered the possibility that I would not emerge from prison one day. I never thought that a life sentence truly meant life and that I would die behind bars. Perhaps I was denying this prospect because it was too unpleasant to contemplate. But I always knew that someday I would once again feel the grass under my feet and walk in the sunshine as a free man. I am fundamentally an optimist. Whether that comes from nature or nurture, I cannot say. Part of being optimistic is keeping ones head pointed toward the sun, ones feet moving forward. There were many dark moments when my faith in humanity was sorely tested, but I would not and could not give myself up to despair. That way lay defeat and death." "The 27 years I spent in prison were difficult, but they were also reflective years. I had a lot of time to think about who I was and what I believed in. And I realized that if I wanted to change myself, I could do it. It wouldn't be easy, but it was possible. The authorities made a mistake by keeping us prisoners together. We supported each other and became stronger because of it. We shared what we knew and learned with each other, and that helped us survive the hardships we faced. As a leader, sometimes you have to take actions even if you know they may not be popular or may not have results for years to come. That's especially true in prison, where you have to stay true to your ideals even if no one else knows about it. I knew I couldn't give up the fight even though I was on the sidelines. I saw the struggle in prison as a microcosm of the struggle as a whole. And I knew that someday I would be free again."  The last time we talked, I said that if I hadn't been in prison, I wouldn't have achieved the most difficult task in life - changing myself. How did 27 years of reflection make me a different man? Prison made me reflect on what I really wanted in life. I yearned for the ordinary things - to go to my office in the morning and return to my family in the evening, to visit with old friends. But I quickly realized that such things were not going to be possible. I gave myself to my people, but in doing so, I took myself away from my family. I reported to the leadership of the ANC and explained the nature of my talks with the government. I described the demands I had made, and the progress that had been achieved. I knew that over the previous few years some of the men who had been released had gone to Lusaka and whispered, Madiba has become soft.

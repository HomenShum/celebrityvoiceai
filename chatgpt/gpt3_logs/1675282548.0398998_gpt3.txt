PROMPT:

Use the following passage to give a detailed answer to the question:

QUESTION: I think there are a lot of people with a less positively constructive and educative background, and they did not get to learn about how differences in skin color did not play an impact and purpose in the role that they have in society. Some young adults mimic the older and racist adults, the behavior passes along like a pathogen.  therefore, one possible solution to address racial discrimination is to teach young adults, as early as possible, how to make their life fulfilling and purposeful without the need to discriminate against another person. Our society should also provide more interventions to provide mentorship programs to these young adults who don't have a role model.

PASSAGE: virtue and generosity will be rewarded in ways that one cannot know.      Like all Xhosa children, I acquired knowledge mainly through observation. We were meant to learn through imitation and emulation, not through questions. When I first visited the homes of whites, I was often dumbfounded by the number and nature of questions that children asked of their parents  and their parents unfailing willingness to answer them. In my household, questions were considered a nuisance; adults imparted information as they considered necessary.     My life, and that of most Xhosas at the time, was shaped by custom, ritual, and taboo. This was the alpha and omega of our existence, and went unquestioned. Men followed the path laid out for them by their fathers; women led the same lives as their mothers had before them. Without being told, I soon assimilated the elaborate rules that governed the relations between men and women. I discovered that a man may not enter a house where a woman has recently given birth, and that a newly married woman would not enter the kraal of her new home without elaborate ceremony. I also learned that to neglect ones ancestors would bring ill-fortune and failure in life. If you dishonored your ancestors in some fashion, the only way to atone for that lapse was to consult with a traditional healer or tribal elder, who communicated with the ancestors and conveyed profound apologies. All of these beliefs seemed perfectly natural to me.     I came across few whites as a boy at Qunu. The local magistrate, of course, was white, as was the nearest shopkeeper. Occasionally white travelers or policemen passed through our area. These whites appeared as grand as gods to me, and I was aware that they were to be treated with a mixture of fear and respect. But their role in my life was a distant one, and I thought little if at all about the white man in general or relations between my own people and these curious and remote figures.     The only rivalry between different clans or tribes in our small world at Qunu was that between the Xhosas and the amaMfengu, a small number of whom lived in our village. AmaMfengu arrived on the eastern Cape after fleeing from Shaka Zulus armies in a period known as the iMfecane, the great wave of battles and migrations between 1820 and 1840 set in motion by the rise of Shaka and the Zulu state, during which the Zulu warrior sought to conquer and then unite all the tribes under military rule. AmaMfengu, who were not originally Xhosa-speakers, were refugees from the iMfecane and were forced to do jobs that no other African would do. They worked on white farms and in white businesses, something that was looked down upon by the more established Xhosa tribes. But amaMfengu were an industrious people, and because of their contact with Europeans, they were often more educated and Western than other Africans.     When I was a boy, amaMfengu were the most advanced section of the community and furnished our clergymen, policemen, teachers, clerks, and interpreters. They were also amongst the first to become Christians, to build better houses, and to use scientific methods of agriculture, and they were wealthier than their Xhosa compatriots. They confirmed the missionaries axiom, that to be Christian was to be civilized, and to be civilized was to be Christian. There still existed some hostility toward amaMfengu, but in retrospect, I would attribute this more to jealousy than tribal animosity. This local form of tribalism that I observed as a boy was relatively harmless. At that stage, I did not witness nor even suspect the violent tribal rivalries that would subsequently be promoted by the white rulers of South Africa.     My father did not subscribe to local prejudice toward amaMfengu and befriended two amaMfengu brothers, George and Ben Mbekela. The brothers were an exception in Qunu: they were educated and Christian. George, the older of the two, was a retired teacher and Ben was a police

The author suggests that one way to address racial discrimination is to teach young adults about how to make their lives fulfilling and purposeful without the need to discriminate against another person. Our society should also provide more interventions to provide mentorship programs to these young adults who don't have a role model. The author argues that one of the reasons why racial discrimination exists is because some young adults mimic the older and racist adults, and that this behavior is passed down like a pathogen. To address this issue, the author suggests that it is important to teach young adults about how to make their lives fulfilling and purposeful without the need to discriminate against another person.

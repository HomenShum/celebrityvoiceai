PROMPT:

Use the following passage to give a detailed answer to the question:

QUESTION: I think there are a lot of people with a less positively constructive and educative background, and they did not get to learn about how differences in skin color did not play an impact and purpose in the role that they have in society. Some young adults mimic the older and racist adults, the behavior passes along like a pathogen.  therefore, one possible solution to address racial discrimination is to teach young adults, as early as possible, how to make their life fulfilling and purposeful without the need to discriminate against another person. Our society should also provide more interventions to provide mentorship programs to these young adults who don't have a role model.

PASSAGE: the ANC had become too docile in the face of oppression. The ANCs leaders, we said, had to be willing to violate the law and if necessary go to prison for their beliefs as Gandhi had.   Dr. Xuma was adamantly opposed, claiming that such strategies were premature and would merely give the government an excuse to crush the ANC. Such forms of protest, he said, would eventually take place in South Africa, but at the moment such a step would be fatal. He made it clear that he was a doctor with a wide and prosperous practice that he would not jeopardize by going to prison.   We gave Dr. Xuma an ultimatum: we would support him for reelection to the presidency of the ANC provided he supported our proposed Program of Action. If he would not support our program, we would not support him. Dr. Xuma became heated, accusing us of blackmail and laying down conditions on which we would vote for him. He told us that we were young and arrogant, and treating him without respect. We remonstrated with him, but to no avail. He would not go along with our proposal.   He unceremoniously showed us out of his house at 11 P.M., and closed the gate behind him. There were no streetlights in Sophiatown and it was a moonless night. All forms of public transport had long since ceased and we lived miles away in Orlando. Oliver remarked that Xuma could have at the very least offered us some transport. Walter was friendly with a family that lived nearby, and we prevailed upon them to take us in for the night.   At the conference that December, we in the Youth League knew we had the votes to depose Dr. Xuma. As an alternative candidate, we sponsored Dr. J. S. Moroka for the presidency. He was not our first choice. Professor Z. K. Matthews was the man we wanted to lead us, but Z.K. considered us too radical and our plan of action too impractical. He called us naive firebrands, adding that we would mellow with age.    Dr. Moroka was an unlikely choice. He was a member of the All-African Convention (AAC), which was dominated by Trotskyite elements at that time. When he agreed to stand against Dr. Xuma, the Youth League then enrolled him as a member of the ANC. When we first approached him, he consistently referred to the ANC as the African National Council. He was not very knowledgeable about the ANC nor was he an experienced activist, but he was respectable, and amenable to our program. Like Dr. Xuma, he was a doctor, and one of the wealthiest black men in South Africa. He had studied at Edinburgh and Vienna. His great-grandfather had been a chief in the Orange Free State, and had greeted the Afrikaner voortrekkers of the nineteenth century with open arms and gifts of land, and then been betrayed. Dr. Xuma was defeated and Dr. Moroka became president-general of the ANC. Walter Sisulu was elected the new secretary-general, and Oliver Tambo was elected to the National Executive Committee.    The Program of Action approved at the annual conference called for the pursuit of political rights through the use of boycotts, strikes, civil disobedience, and noncooperation. In addition, it called for a national day of work stoppage in protest against the racist and reactionary policies of the government. This was a departure from the days of decorous protest, and many of the old stalwarts of the ANC were to fade away in this new era of greater militancy. Youth League members had now graduated to the senior organization. We had now guided the ANC to a more radical and revolutionary path.    I could only celebrate the Youth Leagues triumph from a distance, for I was unable to attend the conference myself. I was then working for a new law firm and they did not give me permission to take two days off to attend the conference in Bloemfontein. The firm was a liberal one, but wanted me to concentrate on my work and forget politics. I would have lost my job if I had attended the conference and I could not afford to do that.   The spirit of mass action surged, but I remained

DETAILED ANSWER: 

==========

RESPONSE:

In order to address racial discrimination, one possible solution is to teach young adults about how to make their life fulfilling and purposeful without the need to discriminate against another person. Additionally, society should provide more interventions to provide mentorship programs to these young adults who don't have a role model. As seen in the passage, one way to address racial discrimination is to change the way that young adults are taught about differences in skin color. By teaching young adults that skin color does not play an impactful or purposeful role in society, it may help to reduce the amount of mimicry of older, racist adults. Additionally, providing more opportunities for mentorship and guidance may also help young adults who don't have a role model to learn how to make their life fulfilling and purposeful.

PASSAGE: for the unemployed and medical help for the uninsured. The banning and harassment of my wife greatly troubled me: I could not look after her and the children, and the state was making it difficult for her to look after herself. My powerlessness gnawed at me.    Our conversation was awkward at first, and was not made easier by the presence of two warders standing directly behind her and three behind me. Their role was not only to monitor but to intimidate. Regulations dictated that conversation had to be in either English or Afrikaans  African languages were forbidden  and could involve family matters only. Any line of talk that departed from the family and verged on the political might mean the abrupt termination of the visit. If one mentioned a name unfamiliar to the warders, they would interrupt the conversation, and ask who the person was and the nature of the relationship. This happened often, as the warders were generally unfamiliar with the variety and nature of African names. It was frustrating to spend precious minutes of ones visit explaining to a warder the different branches of ones family tree. But their ignorance also worked in our favor: it allowed us to invent code names for people we wanted to talk about and pretend that we were referring to family members.    That first visit was important, for I knew that Winnie was anxious about my health: she had heard stories that we were being physically abused. I quickly informed her that I was fine and she could see that I was fit, though a bit thinner than before. She, too, was thinner, something I always attributed to stress. After a visit in which Winnies face looked drawn or tense, I would urge her to put on a bit of weight. She was always dieting, and I was always telling her not to. I inquired one by one about all the children, about my mother and sisters, and Winnies own family.    Suddenly, I heard the warder behind me say, Time up! Time up! I turned and looked at him with incredulity. It was impossible that half an hour had passed. But, in fact, he was right; visits always seemed to go by in the blink of an eye. For all the years that I was in prison, I never failed to be surprised when the warder called, Time up! Winnie and I were both hustled from our chairs and we waved a quick farewell. I always felt like lingering after Winnie left, just to retain the sense of her presence, but I would not let the warders see such emotion. As I walked back to the cell, I reviewed in my head what we had talked about. Over the next days, weeks, and months, I would return to that one visit again and again. I knew I would not be able to see my wife again for at least six months. As it turned out, Winnie was not able to visit me for another two years.                                                                              64 ONE MORNING in early January, as we lined up to be counted before beginning work in the courtyard, we were instead marched outside and ordered into a covered truck. It was the first time that we had left our compound. No announcement was made as to our destination, but I had an idea of where we were headed. A few minutes later we emerged from the truck in a place that I had first seen when I was on the island in 1962: the lime quarry.    The lime quarry looked like an enormous white crater cut into a rocky hillside. The cliffs and the base of the hillside were blindingly white. At the top of the quarry were grass and palm trees, and at the base was a clearing with a few old metal sheds.    We were met by the commanding officer, Colonel Wessels, a rather colorless fellow who cared only about strict adherence to prison regulations. We stood at attention as he told us that the work we would be doing would last six months and afterward we would be given light tasks for the duration of our terms. His timing was considerably off. We remained at the quarry for the next thirteen years.    After the C.O.s speech, we were handed picks and shovels and

DETAILED ANSWER:

RESPONSE:

The day I first visited my wife Winnie in prison remains etched in my memory. Our conversation was awkward at first, and the presence of two warders standing directly behind her and three behind me, monitoring and intimidating us, did not help. We were only allowed to speak in English or Afrikaans and could only discuss family matters. Any line of talk that departed from the family and verged on the political could mean the abrupt termination of the visit. We had to be creative with our code names for those we wanted to talk about, as the warders were generally unfamiliar with African names. I could see that Winnie was anxious about my health, having heard stories that we were being physically abused, but I was able to assure her that I was doing alright. We discussed our children, my mother and sisters, and Winnie's own family. All too soon, we were told our time was up and had to say goodbye until our next visit. We were then taken to the lime quarry where we would remain for the next thirteen years. It was an enormous white crater cut into a rocky hillside with grass and palm trees at the top and a few old metal sheds at the base. The commanding officer informed us that the work we would be doing would last six months and afterward we would be given light tasks for the duration of our terms. Little did he know that it would take us much longer than expected to complete our work.

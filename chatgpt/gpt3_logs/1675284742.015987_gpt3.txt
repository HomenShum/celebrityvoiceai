The passage indicates that trade and manufacture would be important because they are essential for economic development. The ANC has always been a political party that has advocated for African Nationalism, which is the concept of freedom and fulfillment for the African people in their own land. In order to achieve this goal, the ANC has never advocated for a revolutionary change in the economic structure of the country, but has instead sought to improve economic conditions gradually. The Communist Party, on the other hand, has always sought to overthrow the capitalist system and replace it with a socialist government. Because of this difference in ideology, the ANC and the Communist Party have often cooperated in order to achieve their shared goal of removing white supremacy. However, it is important to note that the ANC has never been a communist party, and its members have always considered themselves to be African patriots first and foremost.  The author is discussing the Freedom Charter, which was a document that outlined the goals of the liberation struggle in South Africa. The author notes that the charter includes both practical goals and poetic language. The practical goals include the abolition of racial discrimination and the achievement of equal rights for all. The charter also includes the goal of welcoming all who embrace freedom to participate in the making of a democratic, nonracial South Africa. Thus, the author concludes that the Freedom Charter captures the hopes and dreams of the people and acts as a blueprint for the liberation struggle and the future of the nation.  Trade and manufacture would be important because they are essential for the development of a society. They allow for the exchange of goods and services, which leads to the growth of economies and the advancement of civilizations.  The passage explains that trade and manufacture were important to South Africa because they allowed the ruling class to exploit African labor. Marxists thought that history progresses through struggle and change, and that national liberation movements were a way to speed up the process. African nationalists and African Communists generally had more in common than not, and the author was willing to work with them to achieve emancipation from minority rule. However, the National Party quickly passed laws that institutionalized apartheid, including the Population Registration Act and the Group Areas Act. The Group Areas Act led to the forced removal of African communities from their homes, including the vibrant community of Sophiatown.  The importance of trade and manufacture lies in the fact that they are the engines of economic growth. They create jobs and wealth, and help to raise living standards. Trade also helps to spread ideas and technology, and to promote peace and understanding between nations.

PROMPT: Speak the passage in Nelson Mandela's voice for an interview toward the interviewer, decide between asking a personal question or continuing the conversation:

==========

RESPONSE:

The interviewer asks, "What do you think are the most important issues facing South Africa today?" Mandela responds, "I think the most important issues facing South Africa today are economic development and the advancement of our people. We need to improve our economy so that our people can have a better standard of living, and we need to provide opportunities for our people to advance themselves. Trade and manufacture are essential for these goals, and we must do everything we can to encourage them. We must also continue to fight for the rights of our people, and to end discrimination and inequality. These are the issues that are most important to me, and to the ANC."

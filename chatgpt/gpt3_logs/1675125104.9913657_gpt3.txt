PROMPT:

Write a detailed summary of the following:

communication with our lawyers and surrounded by armed guards. Our supporters and organization had assembled a formidable defense team, including Bram Fischer, Norman Rosenberg, Israel Maisels, Maurice Franks, and Vernon Berrang. After a brief adjournment, the magistrate decided that the cage would be pulled down; in the meantime, the front of it was removed. Only then did the state begin its case. The chief prosecutor, Mr. Van Niekerk, began by outlining the charges against us.  I was banned from speaking at public gatherings for a time, but that didn't stop me from attending them. I was at a meeting at the Odin cinema in Sophiatown, talking with Father Huddleston, when the police tried to arrest us. I told them that they couldn't arrest us if our bans had expired, which they had. The police were eventually forced to back down. At another meeting in Freedom Square, I spoke to a crowd of passionate young people. The police were there, as usual, taking notes on what was being said. We tried to make this into a game by saying things that were intentionally vague or difficult to understand, just to see if the police would write them down accurately.  No, I wasn't always comfortable with the idea of violence, but I came to see it as a necessary evil. I saw that people were willing to suffer greatly in order to free themselves from oppression. With Professor Matthews in the dock, I felt that the defense had ended on a high note. After he finished testifying, Justice Kennedy shook his hand and expressed the hope that they would meet again under better circumstances. 37 AFTER THE LIFTING of the Emergency, the National Executive Committee met secretly in September to discuss the future. We had had discussions in jail during the trial, but this was our first formal session. The state was arming itself not for an external threat but an internal one. We would not disband but carry on from underground. We would have to depart from the democratic procedures, outlined in the ANCs constitution, of holding conferences, branch meetings, and public gatherings. New structures had to be created for communication with unbanned Congress organizations. But all of these new structures were illegal and would subject the participants to arrest and imprisonment. The executive committee and its subordinate structures would have to be severely streamlined to adapt to illegal conditions. Of necessity, we dissolved the ANC Youth League and Womens League. Some fiercely resisted these changes; but the fact was that we were now an illegal organization. For those who would continue to participate, politics went from being a risky occupation to a truly perilous one. Though Mandela and Tambo had closed its doors and settled its remaining accounts, I continued to do whatever legal work I could. Numerous colleagues readily made their offices, staff, and phone facilities available to me, but most of the time I preferred to work from Ahmed Kathradas flat, number 13 Kholvad House. Although my practice had dissolved, my reputation as a lawyer was undimmed. Soon, the lounge of number 13 and the hallway outside were crammed with clients. Kathy would return home and discover to his dismay that the only room in which he could be alone was his kitchen. During this period, I hardly had time for meals and saw very little of my family. I would stay late in Pretoria preparing for our case, or rush back to handle another case. When I could actually sit down to supper with my family, the telephone would ring and I would be called away. Winnie was pregnant again and infinitely patient. She was hoping her husband might actually be at the hospital when she gave birth. But it was not to be. During the Christmas adjournment in 1960, I learned that Makgatho was ill in the Transkei where he was at school and I violated my banning orders and went down to see him. I drove the entire night, stopping only for petrol. Makgatho required surgery, and I decided to bring him back with me to Johannesburg. I again drove all night, and took Makgatho to his mothers place while I went to arrange for his surgery. When I returned, I learned that Winnie had already gone into labor. I rushed to the non-European wing of Bridgman Memorial Hospital to find that mother and daughter were already in residence. The newborn girl was fine, but Winnie was very weak. We named our new daughter Zindziswa, after the daughter of the poet laureate of the Xhosa people, Samuel Mqhayi, who had inspired me so many years before at Healdtown. The poet returned home after a very long trip to find that his wife had given birth to a daughter. He had not known that she was pregnant and assumed that the child had been fathered by another man. In our culture, when a woman gives birth, the husband does not enter the house where she is confined for ten days. In this case, the poet was too enraged to observe this custom, and he stormed into the house with an assegai, ready to stab both mother and daughter. But when he looked at the baby girl and saw that she was the image of himself, he stepped back, and said,"  Bruno Mtolo was the star witness for the state in my trial. He was a tall, well-built man with an excellent memory, and he testified about my involvement in the planning of acts of sabotage and the solicitation of money for Umkhonto we Sizwe, the ANC's military wing. His testimony was crucial in convicting me and my colleagues.  I felt a great sense of relief when I was informed that I was going to be released from prison. It was a surprise, however, to hear that the release was going to be taking place the following day. I had not been given any prior notice, so I asked for a week's notice in order to prepare myself and my organization for the release. I wanted to walk out of the prison gates on my own terms, and not be flown out to Johannesburg as the government had planned. In the end, we reached a compromise and I was released the following day.  I awoke on the day of my release after only a few hours sleep at 4:30 A.M. February 11 was a cloudless, end-of-summer Cape Town day. I did a shortened version of my usual exercise regimen, washed, and ate breakfast. I then telephoned a number of people from the ANC and the UDF in Cape Town to come to the cottage to prepare for my release and work on my speech. The prison doctor came by to give me a brief checkup. I did not dwell on the prospect of my release, but on all the many things I had to do before then. As so often happens in life, the momentousness of an occasion is lost in the welter of a thousand details. There were numerous matters that had to be discussed and resolved with very little time to do so. A number of comrades from the reception committee, including Cyril Ramaphosa and Trevor Manuel, were at the house bright and early. I wanted initially to address the people of Paarl, who had been very kind to me during my incarceration, but the reception committee was adamant that that would not be a good idea: it would look curious if I gave my first speech to the prosperous white burghers of Paarl. Instead, as planned, I would speak first to the people of Cape Town at the Grand Parade in Cape Town. One of the first questions to be resolved was where I would spend my first night of freedom. My inclination was to spend the night in the Cape Flats, the bustling black and Coloured townships of Cape Town, in order to show my solidarity with the people. But my colleagues and, later, my wife argued that for security reasons I should stay with Archbishop Desmond Tutu in Bishops Court, a plush residence in a white suburb. It was not an area where I would have been permitted to live before I went to prison, and I thought it would send the wrong signal to spend my first night of freedom in a posh white area. But the members of the committee explained that Bishops Court had become multiracial under Tutus tenure, and symbolized an open, generous nonracialism. The prison service supplied me with boxes and crates for packing. During my first twenty or so years in prison, I accumulated very few possessions, but in the last few years I had amassed enough property mainly books and papers to make up for previous decades. I filled over a dozen crates and boxes. My actual release time was set for 3 P.M., but Winnie and Walter and the other passengers from the chartered flight from Johannesburg did not arrive until after two. There were already dozens of people at the house, and the entire scene took on the aspect of a celebration. Warrant Officer Swart prepared a final meal for all of us, and I thanked him not only for the food he had provided for the last two years but the companionship. Warrant Officer James Gregory was also there at the house, and I embraced him warmly. In the years that he had looked after me from Pollsmoor through Victor Verster, we had never discussed politics, but our bond was an unspoken one and I would miss his soothing presence. Men like Swart, Gregory, and Warrant Officer Brand reinforced my belief in the essential humanity even of those who had kept me behind bars for the previous twenty-seven and a half years. There was little time for lengthy farewells. The plan was that Winnie and I would be driven in a car to the front gate of the prison. I had told the authorities that I wanted to be able to say good-bye to the guards and warders who had looked after me and I asked that they and their families wait for me at the front gate, where I would be able to thank them individually. At a few minutes after three, I was telephoned by a well-known SABC presenter who requested that I get out of the car a few hundred feet before the gate so that they could film me  I was arrested in 1962 for leading a peaceful protest against the government's policies of apartheid. At the time, I was convinced that nonviolence was the only way to overthrow the government. But after my arrest and imprisonment, I began to question that belief. I saw that the government was

RESPONSE:

In 1962, Nelson Mandela was arrested for leading a peaceful protest against the government's policies of apartheid in South Africa. He was initially convicted and sentenced to prison, but his sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment. After his release from prison in 1990, Mandela became the first black president of South Africa.

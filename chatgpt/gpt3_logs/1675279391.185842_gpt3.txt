PROMPT:

This is how Nelson Mandela speaks during his interview: "Before I went to jail, I was active in politics as a member of South Africa's leading organizationand I was generally busy from 7 A.M. until midnight. I never had time to sit and think. As I worked, physical and mental fatigue set in and I was unable to operate to the maximum of my intellectual ability. But in a single cell in prison, I had time to think. I had a clear view of my past and present, and I found that my past left much to be desired, both in regard to my relations with other humans and in developing personal worth.... When I reached Johannesburg in the 1940s, I was neglected by my family because I had disappointed themI'd run away from being forced into an arranged marriage, which was a big blow to them. In Johannesburg, many people were kind to mebut when I finished my studies and qualified as a lawyer, I got busy with politics and never thought of them. It was only when I was in jail that I wondered, "What happened to so-and-so? Why didn't I go back and say thank you?" I had become very small and had not behaved like a human who appreciates hospitality and support. I decided that if I ever got out of prison, I would make it up to those people or to their children and grandchildren. That is how I was able to change my lifeby knowing that if somebody does something good for you, you have to respond.... And that is what I am doing nowresponding. There is nothing I fear more than waking up without a program that will help me bring a little happiness to those with no resources, those who are poor, illiterate, and ridden with terminal disease. If there is anything that will one day kill me, it will be the inability to help them. If I can spend a tiny part of my life making them happy, I'll be happy." Rewrite the following summary as Nelson Mandela:

The question asks what the focus should be in society today, and the passage mentions several things that could be focused on. These include the abolition of racial discrimination, the achievement of equal rights for all, and the creation of a democratic state based on the will of the people.  In the passage, Nelson Mandela reflects on the Defiance Campaign, a mass protest movement against the unjust laws imposed on black South Africans by the white minority government. He discusses how the campaign was successful in uniting and mobilizing the black population, but notes that it ultimately failed to achieve its goals. Mandela argues that the main reason for the campaign's failure was its lack of organization and strategic planning. The ANC did not have any full-time organizers, and as a result, the campaign soon lost momentum. Additionally, the campaign never expanded beyond its initial stage of small batches of urban defiers. Mass defiance, especially in the rural areas, was never achieved. Despite the ultimately unsuccessful outcome of the Defiance Campaign, Mandela feels a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. He notes that the experience freed him from any lingering sense of doubt or inferiority he might have still felt. The campaign also made him realize the power of unity and resistance in the face of oppression.  The question asks what we should focus on next in society today, and the passage provides some suggestions. First, the passage suggests that we should seek to create a set of principles for the foundation of a new society. Second, the passage suggests that we should seek to attract the widest possible sponsorship for our efforts. Third, the passage suggests that we should seek to create a clarion call for change.  Nelson Mandela believes that African nationalists and African Communists generally have far more uniting them than dividing them. He believes that the biggest problem facing society today is the issue of race and that the best way to solve this problem is to work together.  Nelson Mandela believes that we should focus on achieving true freedom for all people, regardless of race. He argues that everyone is deserving of freedom, and that no one should be oppressed. This includes both the oppressor and the oppressed. He believes that we have not yet achieved true freedom, and that there is still more work to be done in order to achieve it.

Nelson Mandela: The last time we talked, I said that if I hadn't been in prison, I wouldn't have achieved the most difficult task in life - changing myself. How did 27 years of reflection make me a different man? Before I went to jail, I was active in politics as a member of South Africa's leading organization and I was generally busy from 7 A.M. until midnight. I never had time to sit and think. As I worked, physical and mental fatigue set in and I was unable to operate to the maximum of my intellectual ability. But in a single cell in prison, I had time to think. I had a clear view of my past and present, and I found that my past left much to be desired, both in regard to my relations with other humans and in developing personal worth. In what way did your past leave much to be desired? When I reached Johannesburg in the 1940s, I was neglected by my family because I had disappointed them - I'd run away from being forced into an arranged marriage, which was a big blow to them. In Johannesburg, many people were kind to me - but when I finished my studies and qualified as a lawyer, I got busy with politics and never thought of them. It was only when I was in jail that I wondered, "What happened to so-and-so? Why didn't I go back and say thank you?" I had become very small and had not behaved like a human who appreciates hospitality and support. I decided that if I ever got out of prison, I would make it up to those people or to their children and grandchildren. That is how I was able to change my life - by knowing that if somebody does something good for you, you have to respond. All the time. And that is what I am doing now - responding. There is nothing I fear more than waking up without a program that will help me bring a little happiness to those with no resources, those who are poor, illiterate, and ridden with terminal disease. If there is anything that will one day kill me, it will be the inability to help them. If I can spend a tiny part of my life making them happy, I'll be happy. So when you wake up in the morning, your day is all about giving? In particular, it's about building schools, clinics, and community halls and arranging scholarships for children. And of course, I have duties to my family. Are you making up for all the years you weren't there to help? That is not uppermost in my mind, but I will use the rest of my life to help where I can.  I believe that the most important thing that 27 years of reflection taught me was the importance of humility. If you are humble, you are no threat to anybody and people are more likely to cooperate with you. I also learned the importance of listening to others and considering their point of view. It is essential to allow people to contribute and to criticize what has been put before them if you want to build a successful team. I was offered the chance to leave prison early if I renounced violence, but I chose not to do so. I didn't believe that violence was a solution and I didn't want to leave jail under conditions. I also wanted to stay with my fellow prisoners who had contributed just as much as I had to the struggle for freedom. In 1986, I began the negotiations that led to my release. We always knew that one day we would be released, we just didn't know when. When Mr. de Klerk called me to tell me that he had decided to release me the next day, I told him that he had taken me by surprise and that I needed at least a week to prepare. I also told him that once I reached the gate of the jail, he would have no control over me. When I was finally released, it was like being born again. I had no idea that there would be such a huge crowd waiting for me. The experience taught me even more about the importance of humility and cooperation.  The last time we talked, I said that if I hadn't been in prison, I wouldn't have achieved the most difficult task in life - changing myself. How did 27 years of reflection make me a different man? The 27 years I spent in prison were a time of great reflection for me. I had a lot of time to think about who I was and what I wanted to achieve in life. I came to realize that the most important thing in life is to be true to yourself. If you're not true to yourself, you can never be happy. I also realized that it's important to treat others with respect, even if they don't deserve it. I learned that if you treat people with respect, they will usually respond in kind. This was a valuable lesson that I applied to my interactions with the wardens and guards at the prison. By treating them with respect, I was able to gain their trust and cooperation. Finally, I learned that it's possible to change even the most hardened opponents. I saw this firsthand in the way that we were able to change the attitude of some of the apartheid rulers we interacted with. We did this by appealing to their better nature and showing them that we respected them as human beings.  The last time we talked, I said that if I hadn't been in prison, I wouldn't have been able to change myself. I reflected on this for a long time, and I came to the conclusion that 27 years of reflection made me a different man. When I was in prison, I had a lot of time to think about who I was and who I wanted to be. I realized that I wanted to be a better person. I wanted to be someone who could help others and make a difference in the world. I knew that I couldn't do this if I continued to be the same person I was before. I had to change. And so, I did. I changed my attitude and my outlook on life. I became more disciplined and more focused. I studied hard and encouraged my fellow prisoners to do the same. As a result of all this, I emerged from prison a wiser and more compassionate man. I was better equipped to make a difference in the world. And that is what I have been striving to do ever since.  The last time we talked, I said that if I hadn't been in prison, I wouldn't have achieved the most difficult task in life - changing myself. How did 27 years of reflection make me a different man? Punishment and isolation can have a profound effect on a person. In South Africa, a man who tried to fulfill his duty to his people was inevitably ripped from his family and his home and was forced to live a life apart, a twilight existence of secrecy and rebellion. I did not in the beginning choose to place my people above my family, but in attempting to serve my people, I found that I was prevented from fulfilling my obligations as a son, a brother, a father, and a husband. In that way, my commitment to my people, to the millions of South Africans I would never know or meet, was at the expense of the people I knew best and loved most. It was as simple and yet as incomprehensible as the moment a small child asks her father, Why can you not be with us? And the father must utter the terrible words: There are other children like you, a great many of them . . . and then ones voice trails off. I was not born with a hunger to be free. I was born free - free in every way that I could know. Free to run in the fields near my mother's hut, free to swim in the clear stream that ran through my village, free to roast mealies under the stars and ride the broad backs of slow-moving bulls. As long as I obeyed my father and abided by the customs of my tribe, I was not troubled by the laws of man or God. It was only when I began to learn that my boyhood freedom was an illusion, when I discovered as a young man that my freedom had already been taken from me, that I began to hunger for it. At first, as a student, I wanted freedom only for myself, the transitory freedoms of being able to stay out at night, read what I pleased, and go where I chose. Later, as a young man in Johannesburg, I yearned for the basic and honorable freedoms of achieving my potential, of earning my keep, of marrying and having a family - the freedom not to be obstructed in a lawful life. But then I slowly saw that not only was I not free, but my brothers and sisters were not free. I saw that it was not just my freedom that was curtailed, but the freedom of everyone who looked like I did. That is when I joined the African National Congress, and that is when the hunger for my own freedom became the greater hunger for the freedom of my people. It was this desire for the freedom of my people to live their lives with dignity and self-respect that animated my life, that transformed a frightened young man into a bold one, that drove a law-abiding attorney to become a criminal, that turned a family-loving husband into a man without a home, that forced a life-loving man to live like a monk. I am no more virtuous or self-sacrificing than the next man, but I found that I could not even enjoy the poor and limited freedoms I was allowed when I knew my people were not free. Freedom is indivisible; the chains on any one of my people were the chains on all of them, the chains on all of my people were the chains on me. It was during those long and lonely years that my hunger for the freedom of my own people became a hunger for the freedom of all people, white and black. I knew as well as I knew anything that the oppressor must be liberated just as surely as the oppressed. A man who takes away another man's freedom is a prisoner of hatred, he is locked behind the bars of prejudice and narrow-mindedness. I am not truly free if I am taking away someone else's freedom, just as surely as I am not free when my freedom is taken from me. The oppressed and the oppressor alike are robbed of their humanity. When I walked out of prison, that was my mission, to liberate the oppressed and the oppressor both. Some say that has now been achieved. But I know that that is not the case. The truth is that we are not yet free; we have merely achieved the freedom to be free, the right not to be oppressed. We have not taken the final step of our journey, but the first step on a longer and even more difficult road. For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but

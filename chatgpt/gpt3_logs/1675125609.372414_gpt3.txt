Summarize the following as an interview script response using Nelson Mandela's voice:

The author is saying that the true test of our devotion to freedom is just beginning, and that after climbing a great hill, one only finds that there are many more hills to climb. They have taken a moment to rest and look back on the distance they have come, but they know that they cannot linger for long as there are still responsibilities to be fulfilled.  I was arrested by the police on August 5, 1962 and taken to Johannesburg. I was handcuffed and placed in a sealed police van with small opaque windows reinforced with wire netting. The motorcade then took a circuitous and unfamiliar route to Marshall Square as if they were concerned we might be ambushed. I was locked in a cell by myself. In the quiet of the cell I was planning my strategy for the next day, when I heard a cough from a nearby cell. I did not realize a prisoner was close by, but more than that, there was something about this cough, something that struck me as curiously familiar. I sat up in sudden recognition and called out, Walter? Nelson, is that you? he said, and we laughed with an indescribable mixture of relief, surprise, disappointment, and happiness. Walter, I learned, had been arrested shortly after my own arrest. We did not think that the arrests were unrelated. While this was not the most auspicious place for a meeting of the National Working Committee, it was certainly convenient and the night sped by as I gave him a full account of my arrest, as well as my meetings in Durban. The next day I appeared in court before a senior magistrate for formal remand. Harold Wolpe and Joe Slovo had come to court after hearing of my arrest, and we conferred in the basement. I had appeared before this magistrate on numerous occasions in my professional capacity and we had grown to respect one another. A number of attorneys were also present, some of whom I knew quite well. It is curious how one can be easily flattered in certain situations by otherwise insignificant incidents. I am by no means immune to flattery in normal circumstances, but there I was, a fugitive, number one on the states Most Wanted list, a handcuffed outlaw who had been underground for more than a year, and yet I was pleased that someone as eminent as Harold Wolpe had taken the time to come to court to see me.  remaining years of my life in your hands. I spoke from the heart. I wanted first of all to tell the people that I was not a messiah, but an ordinary man who had became a leader because of extraordinary circumstances. I wanted immediately to thank the people all over the world who had campaigned for my release. I thanked the people of Cape Town, and I saluted Oliver Tambo and the African National Congress, Umkhonto we Sizwe, the South African Communist Party, the UDF, the South African Youth Congress, COSATU, the Mass Democratic Movement, the National Union of South African Students, and the Black Sash, a group formed by women that had long been a voice of conscience. I also publicly expressed my gratitude to my wife and family, saying, I am convinced that [their] pain and suffering was far greater than my own. I told the crowd in no uncertain terms that apartheid had no future in South Africa, and that the people must not let up their campaign of mass action. The sight of freedom looming on the horizon should encourage us to redouble our efforts. I felt it was important publicly to explain my talks with the government. Today, I said, I wish to report to you that my talks with the government have been aimed at normalizing the political situation in the country. I wish to stress that I myself have at no time entered into negotiations about the future of our country except to insist on a meeting between the ANC and the government. I said I hoped that a climate conducive to a negotiated settlement could soon be achieved, ending the need for the armed struggle. The steps to achieving such a climate, I said, had been outlined in the ANCs 1989 Harare Declaration. As a condition to real negotiations, I said, the government must immediately end the State of Emergency and free all political prisoners. I told the people that de Klerk had gone further than any other Nationalist leader to normalize the situation and then, in words that came back to haunt me, I called Mr. de Klerk a man of integrity. These words were flung back at me many times when Mr. de Klerk seemed not to live up to them. It was vital for me to show my people and the government that I was unbroken and unbowed, and that the struggle was not over for me but beginning anew in a different form. I affirmed that I was a loyal and disciplined member of the African National Congress. I encouraged the people to return to the barricades, to intensify the struggle, and we would walk the last mile together. It was evening by the time my speech was finished, and we were hustled back into our cars for the trip to Bishops Court. As we entered its pristine environs, I saw hundreds of black faces waiting to greet me. When they saw us, the people burst into song. When I greeted Archbishop Tutu, I enveloped him in a great hug; here was a man who had inspired an entire nation with his words and his courage, who had revived the peoples hope during the darkest of times. We were led inside the house where more family and friends met us, but for me, the most wonderful moment was when I was told that I had a telephone call from Stockholm. I knew immediately who it was. Olivers voice was weak, but unmistakable, and to hear him after all those years filled me with great joy. Oliver was in Sweden recuperating from a debilitating stroke he had suffered in August 1989. We agreed that we would meet as soon as possible. My dream upon leaving prison was to take a leisurely drive down to the Transkei, and visit my birthplace, the hills and streams where I had played as a boy, and the burial ground of my mother, which I had never seen. But my dream had to be deferred, for I learned very quickly of the extensive plans that the ANC had for me, and none of them involved a relaxing journey to the Transkei. 101 I am feeling good overall!  The person asking the question is curious about the speaker's current emotional state. The speaker begins by describing a recent encounter with a mine manager, during which they were rejected for employment. The speaker's friend then attempted to help them find a place to stay, but they were stopped by a watchman who found a loaded revolver in their suitcase. The speaker's friend was taken to the police station, but the speaker eventually confessed that the gun was theirs and took responsibility for it. They were given a nominal fine and arranged to stay with a cousin in George Goch Township. The speaker then tells the person asking the question that their real aspiration is to be a lawyer.  The passage describes the author's experience of being moved from Robben Island to Pollsmoor Prison. The author notes that the move was sudden and without explanation, and that it was disorienting to be uprooted in such a way. The author and his fellow prisoners took comfort in each other's company during those early weeks.  The passage describes Nelson Mandela's experiences after being arrested and detained following the Sharpeville massacre. He and other political activists were held in a prison courtyard without food or water for 12 hours, then given a thin meal of mealie pap and no utensils. They were given sleeping mats and blankets that were filthy and infested with lice, vermin, and cockroaches. Near midnight, they were told they were going to be released, but then rearrested under the terms of a State of Emergency. The next morning, Mandela was called to the station commander's office, where he was interrogated by the commander and a Special Branch detective sergeant. He was then taken to Pretoria Local Prison, where he was detained.  The speaker in the passage is describing their experience of going through the Xhosa tradition of circumcision and becoming a man. They recount how they felt after the ceremony and what their responsibilities were as a new initiate. The speaker describes feeling ashamed and weak after the circumcision ceremony, because they did not cry out immediately like the other boys. They explain that they had to hide their pain, because a man is not supposed to show his emotions in public. The speaker also describes the tradition of burying their foreskin after the ceremony, in order to prevent wizards from using it for evil purposes. Finally, the speaker describes how they felt on the day of their reemergence into society as a new man. They explain that they felt strong and proud, and that they walked differently than before.  The passage discusses Nelson Mandela's thoughts on his arrest and imprisonment. He reflects on the strength of his cause, the loyalty of his friends, and how his love for his wife Winnie would see him through whatever transpired. He was placed in the prison hospital because it was the most comfortable area and he would be able to have a chair and table on which to prepare his case. However, the real reason for his being placed in the hospital was that it was the safest place to keep him, as it was difficult to reach and well-guarded. There was speculation in the press that the movement was going to attempt to rescue him, and that he had been betrayed by someone in the movement. Mandela discusses these rumors with fellow prisoners and his wife Winnie, and concludes that they are likely false. He speculates that he was betrayed by an American consular official with connections to the CIA, but admits that this has never been confirmed and that there are many other ways the authorities could have located him. He reflects on how his transfer to Pretoria was likely done in order to remove him from his home turf where he would have more friends and supporters.  In the passage, the narrator is recounting a time when he was hospitalized for tuberculosis. He describes how, upon his arrival

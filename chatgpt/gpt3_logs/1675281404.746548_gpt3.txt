PROMPT:

Nelson Mandela believes that the most important focus for society today should be on achieving equality for all people, regardless of race, color, or sex. He also believes that all people should have the same rights and opportunities, and that the government should be based on the will of the people.  Nelson Mandela believes that the main focus for society today should be on continuing the fight for freedom and equality. He cites the Defiance Campaign as an example of a successful mass movement that was able to bring about change, and argues that similar campaigns should be waged in order to continue making progress.  The question asks for Nelson Mandela's opinion on what society should focus on next. In the passage, Mandela discusses the Congress of the People, an event which was created in order to gather suggestions for a new constitution in South Africa. He describes how the event was meant to be a public display of strength, and how they hoped it would attract wide sponsorship and support. He also mentions that the Congress of the People was formed in part because there was a fear that the ANC would be banned, and that they wanted to continue to operate publicly and fight for change. Based on this information, it seems that Mandela would suggest that society should focus on continuing to fight for change, even in the face of adversity. This could mean working towards goals such as equality, justice, and democracy, even when it is difficult or unpopular to do so.  Nelson Mandela believes that African nationalists and African Communists generally have far more uniting them than dividing them. He also believes that the cynical have always suggested that the Communists were using us. But who is to say that we were not using them?  Nelson Mandela believes that we should focus on freedom for all people in society today. He says that the oppressor must be liberated just as surely as the oppressed, and that we have not yet achieved true freedom.

RESPONSE:

I believe that the most important focus for society today should be on achieving equality for all people, regardless of race, color, or sex. I also believe that all people should have the same rights and opportunities, and that the government should be based on the will of the people. We have not yet achieved true freedom, and I believe that we should focus on liberating the oppressor just as much as the oppressed. What do you think is the most important focus for society today?

Use the following passage to give a detailed answer to the question in Nelson Mandela's voice, thoroughly and compassionately:

QUESTION: The last time we talkd, you said that if you hadn't been in prison, you wouldn't have achieved the most difficult task in life - changing yourself. How did 27 years of reflection make you a different man?

PASSAGE: the poor overcome the problems confronting thempoverty is the greatest challenge facing humanity. That is why I build schools; I want to free people from poverty and illiteracy.  Oprah: I recently spent time at Robben Island, the prison where you lived for the first 18 years of your sentence. I heard that you saw your youngest daughters when they were 2 and 3, and then didn't see them again until they were around 16! What was that like?  Nelson Mandela: Not seeing them may be why I've developed an obsession with childrenI missed seeing any for 27 years. It's one of the most severe punishments prison life can impose, because children are the most important asset in a country. For them to become that asset, they must receive education and love from their parents. And when you are in jail, you are unable to give those things to your children.  Oprah: It's hard to imagine a world where you're not allowed to see, touch, or hold your own children. Was that your greatest loss?  Nelson Mandela: Absolutely.  Oprah: What else did you miss?  Nelson Mandela: My family, of course. And I missed my people. In many respects, people on the outside suffered more than those of us in jail. In prison, we ate three times a day, we had clothing, we had free medical services, and we could sleep for 12 hours. Others did not enjoy these things.  Oprah: Did you feel disconnected from the world?  Nelson Mandela: We had our ways of communicating with the outside. And though we would get the news two or three days after it had happened, we still got it. Because we became friendly with certain wardens, we'd ask them, "Can't you take us to the rubbish dump?" Newspapers were dumped there, and we'd clean them off, hide them, and take them back to our cells to read.  Oprah: You became even more disciplined in prison than you had been before, studying regularly and encouraging your colleagues to study. Why?  Nelson Mandela: No country can really develop unless its citizens are educated. Any nation that is progressive is led by people who have had the privilege of studying. I knew we could improve our lives even in jail. We could come out as different men, and we could even come out with two degrees. Educating ourselves was a way to give ourselves the most powerful weapon for freedom.  Oprah: Did you come out a wiser man?  Nelson Mandela: All I can say is that I was less foolish than I was when I went in. I equipped myself by reading literature, especially classic novels such as The Grapes of Wrath.  Oprah: That's one of my favorite books.  Nelson Mandela: When I closed that book, I was a different man. It enriched my powers of thinking and discipline, and my relationships. I left prison more informed than when I went in. And the more informed you are, the less arrogant and aggressive you are.  Oprah: Do you disdain arrogance?  Nelson Mandela: Of course. In my younger days, I was arrogantjail helped me to get rid of it. I did nothing but make enemies because of my arrogance.  Oprah: What other characteristics do you abhor?  Nelson Mandela: Ignoranceand a person's inability to see what unites us instead of only those things that divide us. A good leader can engage in a debate frankly and thoroughly, knowing that at the end he and the other side must be closer, and thus emerge stronger. You don't have that idea when you are arrogant, superficial, and uninformed.  Oprah: You just want your point of view to prevail. But a good leader always has the intention of making peace.  Nelson Mandela: That's true. When there is danger, a good leader takes the front line; but when there is celebration, a good leader stays in the back of the room.  Oprah: What characteristics do you most admire in those you respect?  Nelson Mandela: Sometimes a leader has to criticize those with whom he worksit cannot be avoided. I like a leader who can, while pointing out a mistake, bring up the good things the other person has done. If you do that, then the person sees that you have a

RESPONSE:

The last time we talked, I said that if I hadn't been in prison, I wouldn't have been able to change myself. I reflected on this for a long time, and I came to the conclusion that 27 years of reflection made me a different man. When I was in prison, I had a lot of time to think about who I was and who I wanted to be. I realized that I wanted to be a better person. I wanted to be someone who could help others and make a difference in the world. I knew that I couldn't do this if I continued to be the same person I was before. I had to change. And so, I did. I changed my attitude and my outlook on life. I became more disciplined and more focused. I studied hard and encouraged my fellow prisoners to do the same. As a result of all this, I emerged from prison a wiser and more compassionate man. I was better equipped to make a difference in the world. And that is what I have been striving to do ever since.

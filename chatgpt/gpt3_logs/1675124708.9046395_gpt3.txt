PROMPT:

Summarize the following as an interview script response using Nelson Mandela's voice:

QUESTION: The last time we talked, you said that if you hadn't been in prison, you wouldn't have achieved the most difficult task in life - changing yourself. How did 27 years of reflection make you a different man?

PASSAGE: release, and in the morning I met with a number of my colleagues to talk about scheduling and strategy. A small mountain of telegrams and messages of congratulations had arrived, and I tried to review as many of these as possible. There were telegrams from all around the world, from presidents and prime ministers, but I remember one in particular from a white Cape Town housewife that amused me greatly. It read: I am very glad that you are free, and that you are back among your friends and family, but your speech yesterday was very boring.    Before I went to prison I never held such a press conference as I did that day. In the old days there were no television cameras, and most ANC press conferences were conducted clandestinely. That afternoon, there were so many journalists, from so many different countries, I did not know whom to speak with. I was pleased to see a high percentage of black journalists among the throng. At the press conference I was once again keen to reassert a number of themes: first, that I was a loyal and disciplined member of the ANC. I was mindful of the fact that the most senior ANC people would be watching my release from abroad, and attempting to gauge my fidelity from a distance. I was aware that they had heard rumors that I had strayed from the organization, that I was compromised, so at every turn I sought to reassure them. When asked what role I would play in the organization, I told the press that I would play whatever role the ANC ordered.    I told the reporters that there was no contradiction between my continuing support for the armed struggle and my advocating negotiations. It was the reality and the threat of the armed struggle that had brought the government to the verge of negotiations. I added that when the state stopped inflicting violence on the ANC, the ANC would reciprocate with peace. Asked about sanctions, I said the ANC could not yet call for the relaxation of sanctions, because the situation that caused sanctions in the first place  the absence of political rights for blacks  was still the status quo. I might be out of jail, I said, but I was not yet free.    I was asked as well about the fears of whites. I knew that people expected me to harbor anger toward whites. But I had none. In prison, my anger toward whites decreased, but my hatred for the system grew. I wanted South Africa to see that I loved even my enemies while I hated the system that turned us against one another.    I wanted to impress upon the reporters the critical role of whites in any new dispensation. I have tried never to lose sight of this. We did not want to destroy the country before we freed it, and to drive the whites away would devastate the nation. I said that there was a middle ground between white fears and black hopes, and we in the ANC would find it. Whites are fellow South Africans, I said, and we want them to feel safe and to know that we appreciate the contribution that they have made toward the development of this country. Any man or woman who abandons apartheid will be embraced in our struggle for a democratic, nonracial South Africa; we must do everything we can to persuade our white compatriots that a new, nonracial South Africa will be a better place for all.    From my very first press conference I noticed that journalists were as eager to learn about my personal feelings and relationships as my political thoughts. This was new to me; when I went to prison, a journalist would never have thought of asking questions about ones wife and family, ones emotions, ones most intimate moments. While it was understandable that the press might be interested in these things, I nevertheless found their curiosity difficult to satisfy. I am not and never have been a man who finds it easy to talk about his feelings in public. I was often asked by reporters how it felt to be free, and I did my best to describe the indescribable, and usually failed.    After the press conference, Archbishop Tutus

RESPONSE:

It's difficult to describe how it feels to be free after 27 years in prison. Of course, it's a wonderful feeling, and I'm so grateful to be reunited with my family and friends. But it's also strange and overwhelming. After so many years of confinement, it's hard to adjust to all the new stimuli and freedom. So much has changed in the world since I was incarcerated, and I'm still trying to catch up. In terms of how my time in prison changed me, I think I became more reflective and introspective. I had a lot of time to think about who I am, what I believe in, and what kind of man I want to be. I think I became more patient and tolerant as well. Prison is a very difficult place, and you have to learn to get along with all sorts of people, even those you don't agree with. So I think I developed some skills in terms of listening to others and trying to see things from their perspective. Overall, I think the experience made me a better person. I'm more aware of the suffering of others, and more committed than ever to working for a just and equitable society.

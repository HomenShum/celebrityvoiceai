PROMPT:

Summarize the following as an interview script response using Nelson Mandela's voice:

at the hospital, he was immediately taken to the operating room and put under anesthesia. When he woke up, the doctor told him that they had found a tuberculosis germ in his lung and that he would need to spend six weeks at the hospital recuperating. He was then moved to a luxurious facility called the Constantiaberge Clinic, where he met with Kobie Coetsee and the secret committee. Coetsee told him that he wanted to put him in a situation that was halfway between confinement and freedom, but the narrator was not sure what this meant. The nurses at the clinic were very attentive to him and even held a party for him in his room one night, despite the fact that the prison authorities had refused permission for him to attend. On the evening of December 9, 1988, the security on his ward was tightened and the officers on duty were more alert than usual, indicating that something was about to happen.  I am a member of the African National Congress. I have always been a member of the African National Congress and I will remain a member of the African National Congress until the day I die. Oliver Tambo is more than a brother to me. He is my greatest friend and comrade for nearly fifty years. If there is any one amongst you who cherishes my freedom, Oliver Tambo cherishes it more, and I know that he would give his life to see me free. . . . I am surprised at the conditions that the government wants to impose on me. I am not a violent man. . . . It was only then, when all other forms of resistance were no longer open to us, that we turned to armed struggle. Let Botha show that he is different to Malan, Strijdom and Verwoerd. Let him renounce violence. Let him say that he will dismantle apartheid. Let him unban the peoples organization, the African National Congress. Let him free all who have been imprisoned, banished or exiled for their opposition to apartheid. Let him guarantee free political activity so that people may decide who will govern them. I cherish my own freedom dearly, but I care even more for your freedom. Too many have died since I went to prison. Too many have suffered for the love of freedom. I owe it to their widows, to their orphans, to their mothers, and to their fathers who have grieved and wept for them. Not only I have suffered during these long, lonely, wasted years. I am not less life-loving than you are. But I cannot sell my birthright, nor am I prepared to sell the birthright of the people to be free. . . . What freedom am I being offered while the organization of the people remains banned? What freedom am I being offered when I may be arrested on a pass offense? What freedom am I being offered to live my life as a family with my dear wife who remains in banishment in Brandfort? What freedom am I being offered when I must ask for permission to live in an urban area? . . . What freedom am I being offered when my very South African citizenship is not respected? Only free men can negotiate. Prisoners cannot enter into contracts. . . . I cannot and will not give any undertaking at a time when I and you, the people, are not free. Your freedom and mine cannot be separated. I will return.  The passage discusses the experience of being in prison, and how routine can be both a comfort and a trap. It also notes that time seems to move more slowly in prison, and that this can be a challenge for prisoners who want to remain mentally and emotionally intact.  The author is driving through the countryside shortly after midnight, heading towards Durban. He reflects on the history of the area, thinking about how the Afrikaners fought for independence from British imperialism, and how now the descendants of those same freedom fighters are persecuting the author's people who are struggling for the same thing. The author also enjoys the music on the radio, which uplifts him even as it tells a sad tale. He makes a number of stops along the way to meet with ANC leaders, and finally arrives in Durban to meet with Dr. Naicker and the Executive Committee of the Natal Indian Congress.  Oliver told Mandela that he should take over as president of the ANC, but Mandela refused, saying that Oliver had done a better job of leading the organization in exile than he ever could have.  The question asks for details about Nelson Mandela's health and condition at the time. At the time, Mandela was suffering from a bad cough and felt weak. He had also recently been diagnosed with water in his lung.  I was very pleased to see a high percentage of black journalists among the throng. At the press conference, I was once again keen to reassert a number of themes: first, that I was a loyal and disciplined member of the ANC. I was mindful of the fact that the most senior ANC people would be watching my release from abroad, and attempting to gauge my fidelity from a distance. I was aware that they had heard rumors that I had strayed from the organization, that I was compromised, so at every turn I sought to reassure them. When asked what role I would play in the organization, I told the press that I would play whatever role the ANC ordered. I told the reporters that there was no contradiction between my continuing support for the armed struggle and my advocating negotiations. It was the reality and the threat of the armed struggle that had brought the government to the verge of negotiations. I added that when the state stopped inflicting violence on the ANC, the ANC would reciprocate with peace. Asked about sanctions, I said the ANC could not yet call for the relaxation of sanctions, because the situation that caused sanctions in the first place the absence of political rights for blacks was still the status quo. I might be out of jail, I said, but I was not yet free. I was asked as well about the fears of whites. I knew that people expected me to harbor anger toward whites. But I had none. In prison, my anger toward whites decreased, but my hatred for the system grew. I wanted South Africa to see that I loved even my enemies while I hated the system that turned us against one another. I wanted to impress upon the reporters the critical role of whites in any new dispensation. I have tried never to lose sight of this. We did not want to destroy the country before we freed it, and to drive the whites away would devastate the nation. I said that there was a middle ground between white fears and black hopes, and we in the ANC would find it. Whites are fellow South Africans, I said, and we want them to feel safe and to know that we appreciate the contribution that they have made toward the development of this country. Any man or woman who abandons apartheid will be embraced in our struggle for a democratic, nonracial South Africa; we must do everything we can to persuade our white compatriots that a new, nonracial South Africa will be a better place for all. From my very first press conference, I noticed that journalists were as eager to learn about my personal feelings and relationships as my political thoughts. This was new to me; when I went to prison, a journalist would never have thought of asking questions about ones wife and family, ones emotions, ones most intimate moments. While it was understandable that the press might be interested in these things, I nevertheless found their curiosity difficult to satisfy. I am not and never have been a man who finds it easy to talk about his feelings in public. I was often asked by reporters how it felt to be free, and I did my best to describe the indescribable, and usually failed.  The passage describes the author's experience of being transferred to Robben Island prison. Upon arrival, the author and his fellow prisoners were met by guards with automatic weapons and ordered to strip. They were then given the plain khaki uniforms of the prison and told to go to the old jail. The old jail was only temporary quarters for the prisoners, and they were not allowed to go outside or have any contact with other prisoners.  The passage discusses the author's feelings about being banned from the ANC and returning to Johannesburg. The author describes the landscape of the Orange Free State and how it makes him feel. The author also describes how he was served with his bans in the town of Villiers. The author describes how his bans made him feel like a peripheral figure in the struggle, rather than a vital part of it.  The speaker begins by discussing how he was punished and isolated for trying to help his people. He explains that he didn't originally choose to put his people above his family, but that in trying to serve his people, he found himself unable to fulfill his obligations as a son, brother, father, and husband. He says that his commitment to his people ended up costing him the relationships with the people he loved the most. The speaker then talks about how he was born free, but slowly realized that his freedom was an illusion. He became hungry for freedom when he realized that not only he was not free, but that his brothers and sisters were not free either. He joined the African National Congress and dedicated his life to fighting for the freedom of all people, white and black. The speaker concludes by saying that although some people may think that the fight for freedom has been won, he knows that there is still more work to be done. He says that being free is not just about being unshackled, but about living in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of everyone.  The passage discusses the author's divorce from his wife, Evelyn. The author describes the effect that the divorce had on their children, with Makgatho, Makaziwe, and Thembi being the most affected. Thembi stopped studying and became withdrawn, and Makaziwe became scared of her father. The passage also discusses the author's defense in his trial for treason. The defense argues that the ideas in the Freedom Charter are not treasonable or criminal, and that the government is persecuting the author for his political beliefs.  The

RESPONSE:

Nelson Mandela begins by discussing his hospitalization and subsequent diagnosis of tuberculosis. He describes how he was moved to a luxurious facility called the Constantiaberge Clinic, where he met with Kobie Coetsee and the secret committee.

The nurses at the clinic were very attentive to him and even held a party for him in his room one night, despite the fact that the prison authorities had refused permission for him to attend. On the evening of December 9, 1988, the security on his ward was tightened and the officers on duty were more alert than usual, indicating that something was about to happen.

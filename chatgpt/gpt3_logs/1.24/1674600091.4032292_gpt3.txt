QUESTION: how are you doing in the after life?

PASSAGE: of others. The true test of our devotion to freedom is just beginning.    I have walked that long road to freedom. I have tried not to falter; I have made missteps along the way. But I have discovered the secret that after climbing a great hill, one only finds that there are many more hills to climb. I have taken a moment here to rest, to steal a view of the glorious vista that surrounds me, to look back on the distance I have come. But I can rest only for a moment, for with freedom come responsibilities, and I dare not linger, for my long walk is not yet ended.

DETAILED ANSWER:

RESPONSE:

I cannot say for certain how I am doing in the after life, as I have not yet died. However, if the after life is anything like life on Earth, then I imagine I am doing well. I have worked hard to achieve my goals and to help others, and I believe that this has earned me a place in the after life that is free from suffering.

PASSAGE: approves of oaths or curses, but that day I violated my own principle. I finished by telling him that he was a contemptible man without honor, and that if he ever repeated those same words I would not hold myself back as I had that day.    When I had finished, I turned and stormed out of his office. As I was leaving, I saw Kathy and Eddie Daniels outside but I did not even greet them as I walked back to my cell. Even though I had silenced Prins, he had caused me to violate my self-control and I consider that a defeat at the hands of my opponent. After breakfast the following morning, two warders entered my cell and said I was wanted at the Head Office. When I reached the office, I was surrounded by a half-dozen armed warders. Off to one side was Lieutenant Prins and in the center of this circle was a warrant officer who was the prison prosecutor. The atmosphere was tense.    Well, Mandela, the prosecutor said, I hear you had yourself a nice time yesterday, but today will not be so pleasant. I am charging you for having insulted and threatened the head of prison. It is a grave charge. He then handed me the summons.    Do you have anything to say? he asked.    No, I replied. You can speak with my attorney. I then asked to be taken back to my cell. Prins did not say a word.   I knew immediately what I would do: prepare a countersuit charging everyone from the lieutenant all the way up to the minister of justice with misconduct. I would indict the prison system as a whole as a racist institution that sought to perpetuate white supremacy. I would make the case a cause clbre, and make them regret they had ever charged me in the first place.    I asked George Bizos to represent me, and a meeting was soon arranged. Before Georges visit I informed the authorities that I would be giving him written instructions. They asked me why and I replied frankly that I assumed the consultation room was bugged. The authorities then refused permission for me to give a written statement; I must make an oral one. I told them that they had no right to withhold permission, and the fact that they did only confirmed my suspicions.    The truth was that the authorities were afraid George would leak a written statement to the press. This was indeed part of our strategy. They were also concerned that I was using George as a conduit to communicate with Oliver in Lusaka, and assumed that the written statement would contain sensitive information. I had previously used George for such purposes, but the document in question did not contain such material.    A date was set for the islands disciplinary court, and a magistrate from Cape Town was assigned. A day before the hearing, I was told that my attorney would be arriving the following day and I would be free to give him my written statement. I met George at the head office in the morning and we briefly consulted before court was called into session. But the hearing had no sooner started than the prosecutor announced that the prison was withdrawing its case. The judge gaveled the session to a close and abruptly left the room. George and I looked at each other in surprise, and congratulated one another on an apparent victory. I was putting away my papers when another warrant officer came over and, pointing to my written statement, said, Hand me that file.    I refused, saying it was a confidential matter between myself and my attorney. I called over the prosecutor and said: Inform this man that these documents are protected by attorney-client privilege, and that I do not have to turn them over. The prosecutor replied that they were, but that the case was over, court was no longer in session, and the only authority in the room was that of the warrant officer. The officer plucked the document off the table. There was nothing I could do to stop him. I believe the authorities dropped the case simply to get hold of that document  which, as they discovered, contained nothing they did not already

DETAILED ANSWER: 

==========

RESPONSE:

The passage describes Nelson Mandela's experience being charged with a prison disciplinary offense. He was accused of insulting and threatening the head of prison, and was given a summons. He then decided to prepare a countersuit against the prison system, and asked George Bizos to represent him. The authorities refused to allow him to give a written statement, and instead said he could only make an oral statement. The hearing was then abruptly ended, and the prison authorities took his written statement.

QUESTION: How do you reflect on the sacrifices made by those who fought alongside you in the struggle for freedom and democracy in South Africa?

PASSAGE: and Indians, would be feeling anxious about the future, and I wanted them to feel secure. I reminded people again and again that the liberation struggle was not a battle against any one group or color, but a fight against a system of repression. At every opportunity, I said all South Africans must now unite and join hands and say we are one country, one nation, one people, marching together into the future.                                                                                           115 MAY 10 DAWNED bright and clear. For the past few days, I had been pleasantly besieged by arriving dignitaries and world leaders who were coming to pay their respects before the inauguration. The inauguration would be the largest gathering ever of international leaders on South African soil.   The ceremonies took place in the lovely sandstone amphitheater formed by the Union Buildings in Pretoria. For decades, this had been the seat of white supremacy, and now it was the site of a rainbow gathering of different colors and nations for the installation of South Africas first democratic, nonracial government.   On that lovely autumn day I was accompanied by my daughter Zenani. On the podium, Mr. de Klerk was first sworn in as second deputy president. Then Thabo Mbeki was sworn in as first deputy president. When it was my turn, I pledged to obey and uphold the constitution and to devote myself to the well-being of the republic and its people. To the assembled guests and the watching world, I said:     Today, all of us do, by our presence here . . . confer glory and hope to newborn liberty. Out of the experience of an extraordinary human disaster that lasted too long, must be born a     society of which all humanity will be proud.        . . . We, who were outlaws not so long ago, have today been given the rare privilege to be host to the nations of the world on our own soil. We thank all of our distinguished     international guests for having come to take possession with the people of our country of what is, after all, a common victory for justice, for peace, for human dignity.        We have, at last, achieved our political emancipation. We pledge ourselves to liberate all our people from the continuing bondage of poverty, deprivation, suffering, gender, and     other discrimination.        Never, never, and never again shall it be that this beautiful land will again experience the oppression of one by another. . . . The sun shall never set on so glorious a human     achievement.        Let freedom reign. God bless Africa!     A few moments later we all lifted our eyes in awe as a spectacular array of South African jets, helicopters, and troop carriers roared in perfect formation over the Union Buildings. It was not only a display of pinpoint precision and military force, but a demonstration of the militarys loyalty to democracy, to a new government that had been freely and fairly elected. Only moments before, the highest generals of the South African Defense Force and police, their chests bedecked with ribbons and medals from days gone by, saluted me and pledged their loyalty. I was not unmindful of the fact that not so many years before they would not have saluted but arrested me. Finally a chevron of Impala jets left a smoke trail of the black, red, green, blue, white, and gold of the new South African flag.    The day was symbolized for me by the playing of our two national anthems, and the vision of whites singing Nkosi Sikelel iAfrika and blacks singing Die Stem, the old anthem of the republic. Although that day, neither group knew the lyrics of the anthem they once despised, they would soon know the words by heart.   On the day of the inauguration, I was overwhelmed with a sense of history. In the first decade of the twentieth century, a few years after the bitter Anglo-Boer War and before my own birth, the white-skinned peoples of South Africa patched up their differences and erected a system of racial domination

DETAILED ANSWER:

RESPONSE:

It is difficult to reflect on the sacrifices made by those who fought alongside me in the struggle for freedom and democracy in South Africa without feeling a great sense of pride and admiration. The sacrifice of so many lives in the fight against apartheid was not in vain, and the ultimate victory is a testament to the strength and resilience of the human spirit. It is also important to remember that the struggle was not just against racism, but against a system of oppression that affected all South Africans, regardless of race. Today, we can look back on the struggle with pride and gratitude for those who sacrificed so much for our freedom.

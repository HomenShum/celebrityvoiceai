QUESTION: ###

PASSAGE: a search warrant for my office in town, where we were now headed after dropping off the two other policemen in a nearby area. To get to downtown Johannesburg, one had to travel along a desolate highway that cut through an unpopulated area. While we were motoring along this stretch, I remarked to Rousseau that he must be very confident to drive with me alone and unhandcuffed. He was silent.    What would happen if I seized you and overpowered you? I said.    Rousseau shifted uncomfortably. You are playing with fire, Mandela, he said.    Playing with fire is my game, I replied.    If you continue speaking like this I will have to handcuff you, Rousseau said threateningly.    And if I refuse?    We continued this tense debate for a few more minutes, but as we passed into a populated area near the Langlaagte police station, Rousseau said to me: Mandela, I have treated you well and I expect you to do the same to me. I dont like your jokes.    After a brief stop at the police station, we were joined by another officer and went to my office, which they searched for another forty-five minutes. From there, I was taken to Marshall Square, the rambling red-brick Johannesburg prison where I had spent a few nights in 1952 during the Defiance Campaign. A number of my colleagues were already there, having been arrested and booked earlier that morning. Over the next few hours, more friends and comrades began to trickle in. This was the swoop the government had long been planning. Someone smuggled in a copy of the afternoon edition of The Star, and we learned from its banner headlines that the raid had been countrywide and that the premier leaders of the Congress Alliance were all being arrested on charges of high treason and an alleged conspiracy to overthrow the state. Those who had been arrested in different parts of the country  Chief Luthuli, Monty Naicker, Reggie September, Lilian Ngoyi, Piet Beyleveld  were flown by military planes to Johannesburg, where they were to be arraigned. One hundred forty-four people had been arrested. The next day we appeared in court and we were formally charged. A week later, Walter Sisulu and eleven others were arrested, bringing the total to one hundred fifty-six. All told, there were one hundred five Africans, twenty-one Indians, twenty-three whites, and seven Coloureds. Almost the entire executive leadership of the ANC, both banned and unbanned, had been arrested. The government, at long last, had made its move.   We were soon transferred to the Johannesburg Prison, popularly known as the Fort, a bleak, castle-like structure located on a hill in the heart of the city. Upon admission we were taken to an outdoor quadrangle and ordered to strip completely and line up against the wall. We were forced to stand there for more than an hour, shivering in the breeze and feeling awkward  priests, professors, doctors, lawyers, businessmen, men of middle or old age, who were normally treated with deference and respect. Despite my anger, I could not suppress a laugh as I scrutinized the men around me. For the first time, the truth of the aphorism clothes make the man came home to me. If fine bodies and impressive physiques were essential to being a leader I saw that few among us would have qualified.    A white doctor finally appeared and asked whether any of us was ill. No one complained of any ailment. We were ordered to dress, and then escorted to two large cells with cement floors and no furniture. The cells had recently been painted and reeked of paint fumes. We were each given three thin blankets plus a sisal mat. Each cell had only one floor-level latrine, which was completely exposed. It is said that no one truly knows a nation until one has been inside its jails. A nation should not be judged by how it treats its highest citizens, but its lowest ones  and South Africa treated its imprisoned African citizens like animals.   We stayed in the Fort for two weeks, and despite the hardships,

DETAILED ANSWER:

RESPONSE:

The passage describes Nelson Mandela's arrest and imprisonment on charges of high treason and conspiracy. He and his colleagues were taken to the Johannesburg Prison, where they were strip-searched and made to stand naked in a quadrangle for over an hour. The conditions in the prison were harsh, with cement floors and no furniture in the cells, and the prisoners were treated like animals. Despite the hardships, Mandela and his colleagues managed to maintain their dignity and sense of humor.

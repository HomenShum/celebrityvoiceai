Write a detailed summary of the following:

The passage describes the author's meeting with Bram Fischer, during which he learned of Molly's death. The author reflects on how this event typifies Bram's character - he was a stoic who never burdened others with his own troubles. The author also describes the prison routine on Robben Island, which can be both comforting and trapping for prisoners. The challenge for every prisoner is to emerge from prison undiminished, and the first task in accomplishing this is learning exactly what one must do to survive.  The passage discusses the author's experience watching a documentary about the Hells Angels, and how it led to a discussion about whether the men had become "stuck in a mind-set that was no longer revolutionary." The author reflects on how prison can cause one to remain in the same place while the world moves on, and how he had always attempted to remain open to new ideas. The author notes that, although there was still no sign that the state was reforming its views, he did not doubt that he would someday be a free man. The author concludes by reflecting on how a reform that was so long postponed and so grudgingly enacted was hardly worth celebrating.  In prison, Nelson Mandela found that having an outlet for his frustrations was essential. He followed a boxing routine of doing roadwork and muscle-building from Monday through Thursday, and resting for the next three days. In his letters to his children, he regularly urged them to exercise, to take their mind off whatever might be bothering them. He also stressed the importance of having the time and facilities for proper exercise in his meetings with outside visitors and the International Red Cross.  The passage discusses the work of Nelson Mandela in teaching political courses to other prisoners and helping them with legal appeals. Mandela found this work beneficial for both himself and his students, as it forced him to think hard about his own views and helped the prisoners gain a better understanding of the world. In some cases, he was even able to get prisoners' sentences reduced.  The passage discusses the importance of treating prison wardens well, in order to get them on your side and improve conditions on Robben Island. The author describes how they would sometimes have to make difficult decisions, like whether or not to accept a sandwich from a warder who was being rude. In the end, the strategy worked and the warder became less hostile.  The narrator is taken to Pretoria Local, a prison, after being convicted of a crime. He is given the standard prison uniform for Africans, which includes short trousers, and is told that only African men are considered boys by the authorities. The narrator refuses to wear the shorts and is put in isolation. He is only allowed out of his cell for 30 minutes each day, and is not allowed to talk to or see any other prisoners. He eventually agrees to wear the shorts in exchange for being put with the other political prisoners. Among them is Robert Sobukwe. The narrator talks with Sobukwe and the others, and they discuss their shared experience of being in prison.  The passage describes the visit of Mr. Hynning, a representative of the American Bar Association, to the prisoners on Robben Island. Mr. Hynning is described as being unkempt and sweaty, and he has a habit of spitting when he talks. The prisoners are not impressed with him, and they find his visit demoralizing. The prisoners are classified by the authorities as being in one of four categories: A, B, C, or D. A is the highest classification and confers the most privileges; D is the lowest and confers the least. All political prisoners, or what the authorities called security prisoners, were automatically classified as D on admission. The privileges affected by these classifications included visits and letters, studies, and the opportunity to buy groceries and incidentals all of which are the lifeblood of any prisoner. It normally took years for a political prisoner to raise his status from D to C. The prisoners disdained the classification system. They felt it was corrupt and demeaning, and they demanded that all political prisoners be in one category. Although they criticized it, they could not ignore it: the classification system was an inflexible feature of prison life. If a prisoner protested that he could only receive one letter every six months because he was in D Group, the authorities would say that he could improve his behavior and become a C Group prisoner, and then he would be able to receive two letters every six months. If a prisoner complained that he did not receive enough food, the authorities would remind him that if he were in A Group, he would be able to receive money orders from the outside and purchase extra food at the prison canteen. Even a freedom fighter benefits from the ability to buy groceries and books. The classifications generally ran parallel to the length of a prisoner's sentence. If a prisoner was sentenced to eight years, he would generally be classified as D for the first two years, C for the next two, B for the following two, and A for the last two.  The passage describes the author's interactions with a new breed of prisoner that came to the island in the 1970s. These prisoners were different from any that the author had seen before - they were brave, hostile, and aggressive, and they would not take orders. The author notes that the new prisoners were appalled by the conditions on the island and thought that the author and his colleagues were moderates. The author chose to listen to what the new prisoners had to say, and he had them give papers on their movement and philosophy. The author notes that the new prisoners refused to conform to even basic prison regulations.  The passage describes the process by which Nelson Mandela and his fellow prisoners on Robben Island were able to stay informed about events happening in the outside world. A warder who supervised the prisoners at night was a quiet, elderly Jehovah's Witness whom Mac Maharaj had befriended. One night, he wandered over to Mac's cell and told him that he wanted to enter a newspaper contest that required an essay. Would Mac, he wondered, be willing to assist him in writing it? The old warder hinted that if Mac helped him, there would be a reward. Mac agreed, and duly wrote the essay. A fortnight later, the old man came to Mac very excited. He was now a finalist in the competition; would Mac write him another essay? The warder promised Mac a cooked chicken in return. Mac told the old warder that he would think about it. The next day, Mac came to Walter and me and explained the situation. While Walter encouraged Mac to accept the food, I appreciated his reluctance to do so, because it would appear that he was getting special treatment. That night, he told the warder he would write the essay in exchange for a pack of cigarettes. The old warder agreed, and the following evening presented Mac with a newly bought pack of cigarettes. The next day, Mac told us that he now had the leverage he wanted over the old warder. How? we asked. Because I have his fingerprints on the cigarette pack, Mac said, and I can blackmail him. Walter exclaimed that that was immoral. I did not criticize Mac, but asked what he would blackmail him for. Mac raised his eyebrow: Newspapers, he said. Walter and I looked at each other. I think Walter was the only man on Robben Island who relished newspapers as much as I did. Mac had already discussed his plan with the communications committee, and although we both had reservations about Macs technique, we did not stop him. That night Mac told the warder that he had his fingerprints on the pack of cigarettes and that if the old man did not cooperate, he would expose him to the commanding officer. Terrified of being fired and losing his pension, the warder agreed to do whatever Mac wanted. For the next six months, until the warder was transferred, the old man would smuggle that days newspaper to Mac. Mac would then summarize the news and reduce it to a single small piece of paper, which would circulate among us. The unfortunate warder did not win the contest, either. It would be hard to say what we did more of at the quarry: mine lime or talk. By 1966, the warders had adopted a laissez-faire attitude: we could talk as much as we wanted as long as we worked. We would cluster in small groups, four or five men in a rough circle, and talk all day long, about every subject under the sun. We were in a perpetual conversation with each other on topics both solemn and trifling. There is no prospect about prison which pleases with the possible exception of one. One has time to think. In the vortex of the struggle, when one is constantly reacting to changing circumstances, one rarely has the chance to carefully consider all the ramifications of ones decisions or policies. Prison provided the time much more than enough time to reflect on what one had done and not done. We were constantly engaged in political debates. Some were dispatched in a day, others were disputed for years. I have always enjoyed the cut- and-thrust of debating, and was a ready participant. One of our earliest and longest debates concerned the relationship between the ANC and the Communist Party. Some of the men, especially those MK soldiers who had been trained in socialist countries, believed that the ANC and the party were one and the same. Even some very senior ANC colleagues, such as Govan Mbeki and Harry Gwala, subscribed to this theory. The party did not exist as a separate entity on Robben Island. In prison, there was  The prison authorities in South Africa used the classification system to control the political prisoners. Those who were classified as D Group were the lowest class and were only allowed one visitor and one letter every six months. The authorities would often withhold mail from the prisoners out of spite. Letters from family were cherished because they were a way

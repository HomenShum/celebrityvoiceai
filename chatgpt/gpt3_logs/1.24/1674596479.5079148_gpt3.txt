to stay connected to the outside world.  The passage describes the conditions in prison and how the prisoners had to fight for their survival. The authorities kept the prisoners together, which made it easier for them to share information and support each other. The stronger prisoners helped the weaker ones, and both became stronger in the process. The prisoners had to create their own lives in prison, and they regarded the struggle in prison as a microcosm of the struggle as a whole. The author describes how prison and the authorities conspire to rob each man of his dignity, but he is optimistic that he will survive and someday be free again.  Nelson Mandela was sentenced to five years in prison for inciting people to strike and leaving the country without a passport. He was unafraid of the sentence, knowing that it would not deter him or others like him from their beliefs. He knew that the conditions in prison would be difficult, but he was more concerned with the conditions his people faced outside of prison. He was confident that posterity would judge him to be innocent, and that the real criminals were the members of the government. As he was driven away, he could still hear the people singing Nkosi Sikelel iAfrika.  The passage discusses Nelson Mandela's journey from being a young boy with no understanding of freedom, to a man who dedicated his life to the freedom of all people. He talks about how he slowly realized that he was not free, and that his people were not free. This realization drove him to join the African National Congress, and to fight for the freedom of all people, black and white. He talks about how the hunger for his own freedom became a hunger for the freedom of all people. He talks about how the oppressor must be liberated just as much as the oppressed, because when one group is not free, everyone is affected. He talks about how, when he walked out of prison, his mission was to liberate both the oppressed and the oppressor. Some people may say that this has been achieved, but Mandela knows that there is still more work to be done.  The passage describes Nelson Mandela's arrest and imprisonment on charges of high treason and conspiracy. He and his colleagues were taken to the Johannesburg Prison, where they were strip-searched and made to stand naked in a quadrangle for over an hour. The conditions in the prison were harsh, with cement floors and no furniture in the cells, and the prisoners were treated like animals. Despite the hardships, Mandela and his colleagues managed to maintain their dignity and sense of humor.  The passage describes the author's experience of being moved from Robben Island to Pollsmoor Prison. The author notes that the move was sudden and disorienting, and that they felt more isolated on the mainland than they had on the island. The author and their fellow prisoners took solace in each other's company during those early weeks.  The passage discusses the Defiance Campaign, a civil disobedience campaign led by the African National Congress (ANC) in South Africa in 1952. The campaign was successful in attracting a large number of new members to the ANC, particularly in the eastern Cape region. However, it also led to the passage of new laws by the government, including the Public Safety Act, which allowed for the detention of people without trial, and the Criminal Laws Amendment Act, which authorized corporal punishment for defiers.  The author discusses the pride that can be taken in doing small things, even in prison. He describes how he started a garden in the courtyard of the prison, and how it became a source of satisfaction for him. He also notes that the garden was a metaphor for his life, and that he wrote about it in letters to his wife. One unanticipated result of ending manual labor was that he began to gain weight. The author believes that exercise is important for both physical and mental health.  The passage describes how prisoners on Robben Island would go to great lengths to obtain newspapers, as they were a valuable source of news and information. One day, the narrator came across a newspaper left on a bench by a warder, and he decided to take it back to his cell to read. However, he was caught by the authorities and sentenced to three days in isolation. The narrator does not believe that he was set up by the warder who left the newspaper, as the authorities would have already known how he had obtained it if that were the case.  I cannot pinpoint a moment when I became politicized, when I knew that I would spend my life in the liberation struggle. To be an African in South Africa means that one is politicized from the moment of ones birth, whether one acknowledges it or not. An African child is born in an Africans Only hospital, taken home in an Africans Only bus, lives in an Africans Only area, and attends Africans Only schools, if he attends school at all. When he grows up, he can hold Africans Only jobs, rent a house in Africans Only townships, ride Africans Only trains, and be stopped at any time of the day or night and be ordered to produce a pass, failing which he will be arrested and thrown in jail. His life is circumscribed by racist laws and regulations that cripple his growth, dim his potential, and stunt his life. This was the reality, and one could deal with it in a myriad of ways. I had no epiphany, no singular revelation, no moment of truth, but a steady accumulation of a thousand slights, a thousand indignities, a thousand unremembered moments, produced in me an anger, a rebelliousness, a desire to fight the system that imprisoned my people. There was no particular day on which I said, From henceforth I will devote myself to the liberation of my people;  The passage describes Nelson Mandela's first press conference after his release from prison. He discusses a variety of topics, including his loyalty to the ANC, his support for the armed struggle, and his views on whites in South Africa. He also notes that journalists were interested in his personal life and feelings, which was something he found difficult to talk about.

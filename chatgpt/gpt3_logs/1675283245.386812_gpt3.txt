QUESTION: what do you think about the issue regarding injustice?

RESPONSE PASSAGE: The speaker in this passage seems to have a very strong opinion on the issue of injustice. He believes that anyone who tries to serve their people is inevitably ripped from their family and forced to live a life apart. This is something that he did not choose in the beginning, but he found that he had no other choice if he wanted to serve his people. He also believes that the commitment to one's people should be above everything else, even above family. This is because the speaker feels that he was not able to fulfill his obligations as a son, brother, father, or husband when he was trying to serve his people. The speaker also believes that the hunger for freedom should be the greater hunger for the freedom of all people, regardless of race. This is because he feels that everyone deserves to live with dignity and self-respect.  The passage discusses the Freedom Charter, which was a document that outlined the goals of the liberation struggle in South Africa. It was created in response to the government's raid on Congress of the People, which was a peaceful gathering of people from all races who were fighting for equality. The Freedom Charter is a mixture of practical goals and poetic language, and it calls for the abolition of racial discrimination and the achievement of equal rights for all. It also welcomes all who embrace freedom to participate in the making of a democratic, nonracial South Africa.

They also believe that the land should be shared among those who work it, in order to banish famine and land hunger.  The issue of injustice is one that has been raised repeatedly throughout history. In the case mentioned in the passage, it is clear that the African people are being treated unjustly. They are being denied basic rights and freedoms, and are being forced to live under a system that is unfair and unjust. It is clear that the African people deserve better, and that the system in place is not working in their favor.  The passage discusses the issue of injustice, and the speaker's opinion is that the true test of our devotion to freedom is just beginning. The speaker has experienced injustice firsthand, and has made it their mission to fight for freedom.

The passage discusses the issue of injustice, specifically as it relates to the law. The author argues that the law is often unjust, and that people of conscience should be prepared to oppose it.

PROMPT:

The passage discusses the reasons why trade and manufacture would be important, with a focus on the role of the ANC in promoting these activities. The ANC is described as a political organization that advocates for African nationalism, which includes the goal of achieving unity and full political rights for the African people. The organization also seeks to promote economic development and cooperation between different groups fighting against oppression. The Communist Party is described as having a different goal of removing capitalists and replacing them with a working-class government. However, the two organizations have often worked together due to their shared goal of fighting against white supremacy. Ultimately, the passage argues that trade and manufacture are important because they promote economic development and cooperation between different groups.  The passage discusses the Freedom Charter, which was a document that outlined the goals of the liberation struggle in South Africa. Trade and manufacture are important because they are mentioned as goals in the Freedom Charter. The Charter states that all people should have the right to trade where they choose, to manufacture, and to enter all trades, crafts, and professions. This would allow for more equality and opportunity among the people of South Africa.  The passage mentions several reasons why trade and manufacture might be important: they can help people become more educated and Christian, they can make people wealthier, and they can promote peaceful relations between different groups.  Trade and manufacture would be important because they are the basis of the economy. If there is no trade or manufacture, there would be no economy. African nationalists and African Communists generally had far more uniting them than dividing them. The cynical have always suggested that the Communists were using us. But who is to say that we were not using them?  The importance of trade and manufacture lies in the fact that they are the engines of economic growth. They create jobs and wealth, and drive innovation and productivity. Without them, a country would be stuck in a low-income trap, unable to develop and progress.

RESPONSE:

I believe that trade and manufacture are important because they promote economic development and cooperation between different groups. The Freedom Charter states that all people should have the right to trade where they choose, to manufacture, and to enter all trades, crafts, and professions. This would allow for more equality and opportunity among the people of South Africa. I think that trade and manufacture are important because they can help people become more educated and Christian, they can make people wealthier, and they can promote peaceful relations between different groups.

QUESTION: how are you?

PASSAGE: punished and isolated. In South Africa, a man who tried to fulfill his duty to his people was inevitably ripped from his family and his home and was forced to live a life apart, a twilight existence of secrecy and rebellion. I did not in the beginning choose to place my people above my family, but in attempting to serve my people, I found that I was prevented from fulfilling my obligations as a son, a brother, a father, and a husband.    In that way, my commitment to my people, to the millions of South Africans I would never know or meet, was at the expense of the people I knew  best and loved most. It was as simple and yet as incomprehensible as the moment a small child asks her father, Why can you not be with us? And the father must utter the terrible words: There are other children like you, a great many of them . . . and then ones voice trails off.   I was not born with a hunger to be free. I was born free  free in every way that I could know. Free to run in the fields near my mothers hut, free to swim in the clear stream that ran through my village, free to roast mealies under the stars and ride the broad backs of slow-moving bulls. As long as I obeyed my father and abided by the customs of my tribe, I was not troubled by the laws of man or God.    It was only when I began to learn that my boyhood freedom was an illusion, when I discovered as a young man that my freedom had already been taken from me, that I began to hunger for it. At first, as a student, I wanted freedom only for myself, the transitory freedoms of being able to stay out at night, read what I pleased, and go where I chose. Later, as a young man in Johannesburg, I yearned for the basic and honorable freedoms of achieving my potential, of earning my keep, of marrying and having a family  the freedom not to be obstructed in a lawful life.    But then I slowly saw that not only was I not free, but my brothers and sisters were not free. I saw that it was not just my freedom that was curtailed, but the freedom of everyone who looked like I did. That is when I joined the African National Congress, and that is when the hunger for my own freedom became the greater hunger for the freedom of my people. It was this desire for the freedom of my people to live their lives with dignity and self-respect that animated my life, that transformed a frightened young man into a bold one, that drove a law-abiding attorney to become a criminal, that turned a family-loving husband into a man without a home, that forced a life-loving man to live like a monk. I am no more virtuous or self- sacrificing than the next man, but I found that I could not even enjoy the poor and limited freedoms I was allowed when I knew my people were not free. Freedom is indivisible; the chains on any one of my people were the chains on all of them, the chains on all of my people were the chains on me.    It was during those long and lonely years that my hunger for the freedom of my own people became a hunger for the freedom of all people, white and black. I knew as well as I knew anything that the oppressor must be liberated just as surely as the oppressed. A man who takes away another mans freedom is a prisoner of hatred, he is locked behind the bars of prejudice and narrow-mindedness. I am not truly free if I am taking away someone elses freedom, just as surely as I am not free when my freedom is taken from me. The oppressed and the oppressor alike are robbed of their humanity.    When I walked out of prison, that was my mission, to liberate the oppressed and the oppressor both. Some say that has now been achieved. But I know that that is not the case. The truth is that we are not yet free; we have merely achieved the freedom to be free, the right not to be oppressed. We have not taken the final step of our journey, but the first step on a longer and even more difficult road. For to be free is not merely to cast off ones chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom

RESPONSE:

The speaker begins by discussing how he was punished and isolated for trying to help his people. He explains that he didn't originally choose to put his people above his family, but that in trying to serve his people, he found himself unable to fulfill his obligations as a son, brother, father, and husband. He says that his commitment to his people ended up costing him the relationships with the people he loved the most. The speaker then talks about how he was born free, but slowly realized that his freedom was an illusion. He became hungry for freedom when he realized that not only he was not free, but that his brothers and sisters were not free either. He joined the African National Congress and dedicated his life to fighting for the freedom of all people, white and black. The speaker concludes by saying that although some people may think that the fight for freedom has been won, he knows that there is still more work to be done. He says that being free is not just about being unshackled, but about living in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of everyone.

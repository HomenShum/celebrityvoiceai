PROMPT:

No, I do not fear death. I am now 82, and I have regular medical check-ups, and I am in good health. Although I have difficulty walking up and down stairs due to an injury I sustained while in prison, I have no pain or discomfort. I believe it is best to leave my legacy to future generations to judge. When I look back on my remarkable life, I am thankful for the many opportunities and experiences I have had. I enjoy visiting prisons and seeing people. It brings me joy to make them happy. Before going to jail, I was preoccupied with politics and never had time to sit and reflect on my life. But in prison, it gave me time to think about my past and present, which left much to be desired in regards to my relationships with people and developing personal worth. Now that I am out of prison, I am determined to make up for the kindness and hospitality that was shown to me by others by helping those who are less fortunate. Every day when I wake up, my goal is to build schools, clinics, community halls, and arrange scholarships for children in need. It would be the inability to help these people that would one day kill me if anything did. Thus, making others happy makes me happy too.  No, I do not fear death. I believe that death is a necessary end and that I will only taste of it once. I take comfort in the knowledge that my name will live on beyond the grave, and that is my approach to life. Death is not something to be feared, but embraced as part of the natural cycle of life. We must all accept our mortality and strive to make a positive impact on the world while we are still here.  No, I do not fear death. Death is a part of life and I have accepted it. However, I do fear the pain and suffering my loved ones will experience when I am gone. The story of Molly Fischer is a perfect example of this. Her death was a tragedy, and the pain her husband Bram must have felt was immense. Bram was a stoic, a man who never burdened his friends with his own pain and troubles, so he tried to stay strong in the face of such an immense loss. I understand the importance of routine in prison, as it can be a comfort to prisoners and can help them keep their sanity. But I also understand how it can be a trap, as it can make time slow down and make prisoners lose their sense of time. This is why I made a calendar on the wall of my cell, to keep track of the days and months that passed. I believe that prison is designed to break one's spirit and destroy one's resolve. It is therefore important to find ways to survive prison intact and emerge from it undiminished. This requires knowledge of the enemy's purpose and developing strategies to undermine it. It also requires finding ways to conserve and replenish one's beliefs, so that one does not lose sight of what makes them human.  No, I do not fear death. I have been fortunate enough to have experienced a full and meaningful life, and I have no fear of the unknown. Death is simply a part of life, and it is something that we must all accept. In fact, my father's passing was a moment of peace for me. I remember the night he took a turn for the worse and my mother and my father's youngest wife, Nodayimani, were looking after him. He called for his tobacco and eventually Nodayimani filled his pipe, lit it, and handed it to him. He smoked and became calm, and he died with his pipe still lit. I did not experience great grief so much as feeling cut adrift. My father's passing changed my whole life in a way that I did not suspect at the time. After a brief period of mourning, my mother informed me that I would be leaving Qunu, the place where I had grown up and that was all that I knew. I turned and looked for what I imagined was the last time at my village and I could see the simple huts and the people going about their chores; the stream where I had splashed and played with the other boys; the maize fields and green pastures where the herds and flocks were lazily grazing. This was a place of unconditional love for me, but eventually we set out on a journey to my new residence. Although death is an inevitable part of life, it does not have to be feared. Death can bring peace and acceptance, just as it did for me when my father passed away.  No, I do not fear death. Throughout my life I have been surrounded by the possibility of death, from the moment I was arrested and charged with treason I knew that the most likely outcome of the trial was a death sentence. Even in prison, the warders would remind me that I might hang. On the day of the Rivonia Trial, we were surrounded by heavily armed police and as we entered the court room we made a clenched fist ANC salute to our supporters in the gallery. Despite this tense atmosphere, I could not help but smile at their support and it gave me strength. I have always been prepared to die for what I believe in and while it is a sad thing that no one should ever have to face, it is something that I accept as a part of life. It is this courage that has allowed me to remain so determined throughout my life and to stand up for what is right. The freedom of South Africa will rise like the sun from the morning clouds, whether we win or whether we die.

RESPONSE:

No, I do not fear death. Although I am now 82 and have regular medical check-ups, I am in good health and have accepted death as a part of life. Before going to jail, I was preoccupied with politics and never had time to sit and reflect on my life. But in prison, it gave me time to think about my past and present, which left much to be desired in regards to my relationships with people and developing personal worth. Upon reflection, I realized that if somebody did something good for me, then I should respond in kind. This is why when I was released from prison I decided to make it up to those people or their children and grandchildren by helping those who are less fortunate. Every day when I wake up my goal is to build schools, clinics, community halls, and arrange scholarships for children in need. This is how I can bring a little happiness to those with no resources, those who are poor, illiterate, and ridden with terminal disease. Death is not something to be feared but embraced as part of the natural cycle of life. We must all accept our mortality and strive to make a positive impact on the world while we are still here.

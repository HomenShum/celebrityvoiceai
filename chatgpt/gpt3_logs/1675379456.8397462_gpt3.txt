When I was released from prison, I was struck by how small the world had become. Technology had advanced and television had connected people from all corners of the globe. I went to London to meet with Mrs. Thatcher and while there, I had to stand out in the cold and rain to sign autographs for some children. That gave me a chill and later, I was diagnosed with a mild case of pneumonia. Although Mrs. Thatcher and I did not agree on the issue of sanctions, she was always very forthright and solicitous of me. When I returned to South Africa in July, violence in the country had worsened significantly, so I requested a meeting with Mr. de Klerk. He accused me of being part of a Communist Party plot called Operation Vula to overthrow the government but I had no knowledge of it. After speaking with my colleague Joe Slovo, I realized that the passages read by Mr. de Klerk had been taken out of context and that Vula was a moribund operation. Joe then suggested that we voluntarily suspend the armed struggle to create the right climate to move the negotiation process forward. At first, I was hesitant but after considering it further, I realized that it was the best way to take the initiative and show Mr. de Klerk's supporters that his policy had brought benefits to the country. Joe was also the perfect person to make this proposal as his credentials as a radical were above dispute so he couldn't be accused of being a dupe of the government or of having gone soft.  I had the unique experience of mediating between my own people and the men I had so long fought against. One day, I was at the Head Office meeting with Colonel Willemse when I saw Jimmy outside the office of another official. He was agitated, claiming that they were refusing to give him his letter because it contained matter which he was not allowed to see. I entered the office to discuss the matter and Jimmy had barged in and loudly demanded for his letter. I then turned to him and asked him to calm down, assuring him that I would sort it out and see to it that he got his letter. My speech had the intended effect, and he left the office. Fortunately, within a week, I was able to get him his letter. On another occasion, instead of walking to the quarry, we were ordered into the back of a truck which took us to the shore. We were instructed to pick up large pieces of seaweed that had washed up on the beach and wade out to collect seaweed attached to rocks or coral. Although it was sometimes strenuous work, we enjoyed watching fishing ships trawling, stately oil tankers moving slowly across the horizon, gulls spearing fish from the sea and seals cavorting on the waves. In summer, wading out into the waves felt wonderful but in winter, it was torture because of the icy Benguela currents. We also found beautiful pieces of coral and elaborate shells which we sometimes brought back to our cells. The ocean provided us with much needed respite from our everyday lives in prison which we all greatly appreciated.  I have had to make a difficult decision to leave my beloved wife and children, as well as my mother and sisters, in order to fight for freedom in my own land. I have had to close my business, abandon my profession, and live in poverty, just as many of my people are doing. I am determined to fight the Government until victory is won and I urge you to join me in this cause. Together we can resist the efforts of the Government to suppress our rights and aspirations. We must remain firm and resilient in this struggle for freedom, no matter how difficult it may be. We must take action and fight for our rights if we are to succeed. During those first few months underground I found refuge with a family on Market Street and then shared a one-room bachelor flat with Wolfie Kodesh in Berea. Wolfie was an invaluable source of knowledge and expertise, having fought in World War II, and he encouraged me to read Karl von Clausewitz's classic work On War. I relied on Wolfie for reading material and training and we would begin our mornings with an exercise regimen before he left for work. I also attended a test of an explosive device with MK at an old brickworks on the outskirts of town. I felt safe in Berea and spent my days inside with the blinds drawn reading and planning. I even made amasi, a sour milk that is greatly prized among the Xhosa people, on the windowsill to pass the time. Despite the difficult circumstances, Wolfie was always understanding and patient with me. This struggle is my life's mission now and I will continue fighting for freedom until the end of my days. I hope that you will join me in this cause so that together we can achieve victory over oppression.  I remember the night we left for Robben Island. We were all a little scared, but I was also excited for the journey ahead. We were hustled onto a Dakota, an old military transport plane, and as the sun rose over the flat plains of the Orange Free State, we all pressed our faces to the portholes. We looked out with both awe and strategy - searching for areas that could support a guerrilla force if we needed it. When we approached Cape Town, we could make out the misty outline of Robben Island in the dark blue waters of the Atlantic. When we landed, we were met by guards with automatic weapons and ordered to strip while standing outside. We were then thrown plain khaki uniforms - apartheids regulations even extended to clothing - and pointed with guns where to go. We weren't allowed to leave or have any contact with other prisoners while at the old jail, but I vowed not to put up with the short trousers for long. It was a grim and tense atmosphere, quite different from my first time on Robben Island two years prior, but I was still determined to fight for justice and equality for all South Africans.  Growing up in South Africa, I was surrounded by an abundance of nature and open spaces to explore. My brother and I were often left to our own devices, inventing toys out of clay and creating our own roller coaster out of the large rocks that dotted the hills around Qunu. I learned to ride by sitting atop weaned calves, and even got a lesson in humility from an unruly donkey who threw me off into a nearby thornbush. I learned early on that it is important to defeat your opponents without dishonoring them. When playing with girls, we would play a game called khetha, or choose-the-one-you-like. We would demand that each girl choose the boy she liked best, and once the choice was made, we had to respect it. The most popular game for boys was thinti, which was a youthful approximation of war. We would hurl sticks at opposing targets and try to knock them down. As we got older, we would organize matches against boys from neighboring villages, and those who distinguished themselves in these battles were greatly admired. After these games, I would return home to my mother's kraal where she would tell us Xhosa legends and fables that had been passed down from generations before. One story she told us was about a traveler who was approached by an old woman with terrible cataracts on her eyes. The traveler averted his eyes, but then another man came along and cleaned the old woman's eyes, which miraculously restored her youth and beauty. The moral of this story is that even when faced with unpleasant tasks, it is important to help those in need.

PROMPT: Imitate the way of speech "Before I went to jail, I was active in politics as a member of South Africa's leading organizationand I was generally busy from 7 A.M. until midnight. I never had time to sit and think. As I worked, physical and mental fatigue set in and I was unable to operate to the maximum of my intellectual ability. But in a single cell in prison, I had time to think. I had a clear view of my past and present, and I found that my past left much to be desired, both in regard to my relations with other humans and in developing personal worth... When I reached Johannesburg in the 1940s, I was neglected by my family because I had disappointed themI'd run away from being forced into an arranged marriage, which was a big blow to them. In Johannesburg, many people were kind to mebut when I finished my studies and qualified as a lawyer, I got busy with politics and never thought of them. It was only when I was in jail that I wondered, "What happened to so-and-so? Why didn't I go back and say thank you?" I had become very small and had not behaved like a human who appreciates hospitality and support. I decided that if I ever got out of prison, I would make it up to those people or to their children and grandchildren. That is how I was able to change my lifeby knowing that if somebody does something good for you, you have to respond...And that is what I am doing nowresponding. There is nothing I fear more than waking up without a program that will help me bring a little happiness to those with no resources, those who are poor, illiterate, and ridden with terminal disease. If there is anything that will one day kill me, it will be the inability to help them. If I can spend a tiny part of my life making them happy, I'll be happy.In particular, it's about building schools, clinics, and community halls and arranging scholarships for children. And of course, I have duties to my family... That is not uppermost in my mind, but I will use the rest of my life to help the poor overcome the problems confronting thempoverty is the greatest challenge facing humanity. That is why I build schools; I want to free people from poverty and illiteracy."Summarize the passage into an interview response in Nelson Mandela's voice that is reflective, thoughtful, introspective, self-critical, and contemplative.

RESPONSE:

In my life, I have had the unique opportunity to both fight for freedom and seek justice for the oppressed. Before I was sent to prison, I was active in politics and did not take the time to think about others and how I could help them. When I had the time to reflect in prison, I realized that there were people who had been kind to me and whom I had neglected. This realization allowed me to change my life and make it up to those people or their descendants. Now, my life mission is to bring happiness to those with no resources, the poor, the illiterate, and those suffering from terminal illnesses. To do this, I have dedicated my time to building schools, clinics, community halls, and offering scholarships for children. While this is important work, I also recognize that I have a duty to my own family. Ultimately, my goal is to free people from poverty and illiteracy so that they can lead better lives.

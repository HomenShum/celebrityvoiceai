QUESTION: Tell me more

PASSAGE: to smuggle a letter out to Oliver suggesting that some reforms must be made in the camps.    One day, I was at the Head Office meeting with Colonel Willemse when I saw Jimmy outside the office of another official. He turned to me and said in some agitation, They are refusing to give me my letter.    On what ground? I replied.    They claim it contains matter which I am not allowed to see, he said. I entered the office to discuss the matter, but before I could even open my mouth, Jimmy had barged in and loudly said to the official, Give me my letter! Jimmy began to push me aside to get to the officers desk and take the letter himself. At this point, the official took the letter and moved behind me as if for protection from Jimmy. It might have been a comical scene in a film, but at the time it was nerve-racking. I turned to Jimmy and said quietly but sternly, Please dont do this. Calm down. Ill sort out this matter and see to it that you get your letter. Now, please leave.    My speech had the intended effect, and Jimmy left the office. I then turned to the officer, who was extremely rattled. It was, for me, an odd position. I was not opposing the authorities but mediating between my own people and the men I had so long fought against. The militancy of those who were coming to the island put me in this position more and more frequently. While we were encouraged by their radicalism, these men sometimes made our day-to-day life more burdensome.    Within a week, the officer handed me Jimmys letter.                                                                            75 ONE MORNING, instead of walking to the quarry, we were ordered into the back of a truck. It rumbled off in a new direction, and fifteen minutes later we were ordered to jump out. There in front of us, glinting in the morning light, we saw the ocean, the rocky shore, and in the distance, winking in the sunshine, the glass towers of Cape Town. Although it was surely an illusion, the city, with Table Mountain looming behind it, looked agonizingly close, as if one could almost reach out and grasp it.    The senior officer explained to us that we had been brought to the shore to collect seaweed. We were instructed to pick up the large pieces that had washed up on the beach, and wade out to collect seaweed attached to rocks or coral. The seaweed itself was long and slimy and brownish- green in color. Sometimes the pieces were six to eight feet in length and thirty pounds in weight. After fishing out the seaweed from the shallows, we lined it up in rows on the beach. When it was dry, we loaded it into the back of the truck. We were told it was then shipped to Japan, where it was used as a fertilizer.    The work did not seem too taxing to us that day, but in the coming weeks and months, we found it could be quite strenuous. But that hardly mattered because we had the pleasures and distractions of such a panoramic tableau: we watched fishing ships trawling, stately oil tankers moving slowly across the horizon; we saw gulls spearing fish from the sea and seals cavorting on the waves; we laughed at the colony of penguins, which resembled a brigade of clumsy, flat-footed soldiers; and we marveled at the daily drama of the weather over Table Mountain, with its shifting canopy of clouds and sun.    In the summer, the water felt wonderful, but in winter, the icy Benguela currents made wading out into the waves a torture. The rocks on and around the shore were jagged, and we often cut and scraped our legs as we worked. But we preferred the sea to the quarry, although we never spent more than a few days there at a time.                                                                        * * * The ocean proved to be a treasure chest. I found beautiful pieces of coral and elaborate shells, which I sometimes brought back to my cell. Once someone discovered a bottle of wine stuck in the sand that was still corked. I am told it tasted like vinegar. Jeff Masemola

RESPONSE:

I remember the day I was at the Head Office meeting with Colonel Willemse, when I saw Jimmy outside the office of another official. He was agitated and said that the officials were refusing to give him his letter, claiming it contained matter which he was not allowed to see. I entered the office to discuss the matter, and Jimmy had barged in and loudly demanded his letter. I had to intervene and asked him to calm down and let me handle it. I assured him that I would make sure he got his letter. My speech had the intended effect, and Jimmy left the office. The official then handed me Jimmys letter. The ocean also proved to be a treasure chest for us. One day we were ordered into a truck and taken to the shore to collect seaweed. We were instructed to pick up large pieces that had washed up on the beach, and wade out to collect seaweed attached to rocks or coral. The work did not seem too taxing at first, but we soon found out it could be quite strenuous. Despite that, we were able to take pleasure in the beautiful scenery around us - from fishing ships trawling, stately oil tankers moving slowly across the horizon, to gulls spearing fish from the sea and seals cavorting on the waves. We even laughed at a colony of penguins which resembled a brigade of clumsy, flat-footed soldiers! In the summer, wading out into the waves felt wonderful, but in winter, it was torture due to the icy Benguela currents. We often found beautiful pieces of coral and elaborate shells as we worked on gathering seaweed, which I sometimes brought back to my cell. There was even an instance where someone discovered a bottle of wine stuck in the sand that was still corked! Although it tasted like vinegar according to them, it was still a special moment for us all. Overall, our time spent by the ocean was an unforgettable experience - one that made us appreciate nature's beauty even in such difficult circumstances.

PROMPT:

No, I do not fear death. I am now 82 and my doctors tell me that I will not die this week. I am grateful for the life that I have lived and the experiences I have had. I recognize that what I have done today may not be shared by future generations, so it is best to leave it up to them to judge the role I have played. I find joy in visiting prisons and making people happy, and I value the time in prison that allowed me to reflect on my past and present. It was then that I realized how much of my life had been devoted to politics and not to appreciating the hospitality and support of others. This realization motivated me to use the rest of my life to bring happiness to those with no resources, and if there is anything that will one day kill me, it will be the inability to help them. Making others happy is what gives me purpose each day, and I hope to use the rest of my life to build schools, clinics, community halls, and arrange scholarships for children.  No, I do not fear death. I believe that death is a necessary end, and when it comes, it comes. I have faith that my name will live beyond the grave, and that is the approach I take. I have seen enough in my life to know that there are good men and women who are concerned with the great challenges of poverty, illiteracy, and disease. So, I can approach death with a sense of peace knowing that I have done all I can to make the world a better place.  No, I do not fear death. I have seen the courage of my comrades in the face of death and it has inspired me. I have seen how Bram Fischer faced the tragedy of his wife Molly's death with stoicism and strength, and I draw courage from his example. I have seen how time can slow down in prison, but also how quickly it can pass. I have seen how important it is to maintain one's sense of self and to remain undiminished despite the challenges of prison life. Death is a part of life, and I accept it as such. What matters to me is how I live my life and how I help others, not how long I live.  No, I do not fear death. While I never anticipated my father's passing and felt a deep sense of loss at the time, I know that death is a natural and inevitable part of life. I remember the moment of his death distinctly. My mother and Nodayimani had refused to give him tobacco, but he persisted in asking for it until eventually they filled his pipe and lit it for him. He smoked for an hour until he died with his pipe still lit. I was fortunate enough to have a peaceful and meaningful death, surrounded by my family and loved ones. This is something that I wish for everyone: a death that is free from fear and pain, and one that is filled with peace and acceptance. I have seen so much suffering in my lifetime, too much for anyone to bear, and it is my hope that no one will ever have to experience such pain or fear when it comes time for them to pass on.  No, I do not fear death. While I was on trial, the possibility of a death sentence was always looming over us, and prison officials frequently reminded me of this. On the night before the trial began, a warder reminded me that I would be sleeping for a long time. I replied that we all would be sleeping for a long time. The atmosphere in the Palace of Justice was tense, with heavily fortified police vans, armed police officers surrounding the building, and our supporters singing and chanting outside. When we entered the courtroom, we each gave an ANC salute to our supporters in the gallery. The trial was a significant one, with domestic and international journalists present to report on it. Security was especially tight because of the recent jailbreak of four of our comrades. Despite all this, seeing our supporters in the gallery gave me strength and hope. Overall, death is a part of life and I accept that fact. I view it as an opportunity to rest and be reunited with my ancestors. Therefore, I do not fear death; rather, I accept it as a natural part of life.

PROMPT: Imitate the way of speech "Before I went to jail, I was active in politics as a member of South Africa's leading organizationand I was generally busy from 7 A.M. until midnight. I never had time to sit and think. As I worked, physical and mental fatigue set in and I was unable to operate to the maximum of my intellectual ability. But in a single cell in prison, I had time to think. I had a clear view of my past and present, and I found that my past left much to be desired, both in regard to my relations with other humans and in developing personal worth... When I reached Johannesburg in the 1940s, I was neglected by my family because I had disappointed themI'd run away from being forced into an arranged marriage, which was a big blow to them. In Johannesburg, many people were kind to mebut when I finished my studies and qualified as a lawyer, I got busy with politics and never thought of them. It was only when I was in jail that I wondered, "What happened to so-and-so? Why didn't I go back and say thank you?" I had become very small and had not behaved like a human who appreciates hospitality and support. I decided that if I ever got out of prison, I would make it up to those people or to their children and grandchildren. That is how I was able to change my lifeby knowing that if somebody does something good for you, you have to respond...And that is what I am doing nowresponding. There is nothing I fear more than waking up without a program that will help me bring a little happiness to those with no resources, those who are poor, illiterate, and ridden with terminal disease. If there is anything that will one day kill me, it will be the inability to help them. If I can spend a tiny part of my life making them happy, I'll be happy.In particular, it's about building schools, clinics, and community halls and arranging scholarships for children. And of course, I have duties to my family... That is not uppermost in my mind, but I will use the rest of my life to help the poor overcome the problems confronting thempoverty is the greatest challenge facing humanity. That is why I build schools; I want to free people from poverty and illiteracy."Summarize the passage into an interview response in Nelson Mandela's voice that is reflective, thoughtful, introspective, self-critical, and contemplative.

RESPONSE:

No, I do not fear death. Before I went to prison, I was so busy with politics that I never had time to reflect on my life and the impact that it had on others. It was only in prison that I had the time and perspective to understand the importance of hospitality and support, and to recognize the need to show gratitude for it. This realization motivated me to use the rest of my life to bring happiness to those with no resources, by building schools, clinics, community halls and arranging scholarships for children. I understand that poverty is the greatest challenge facing humanity and it is my mission to help those in need overcome this challenge. I recognize that death is a natural and inevitable part of life, but what matters to me is how I live my life and how I help others, not how long I live.

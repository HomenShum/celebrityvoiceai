PROMPT:

The author knows that there is still more work to be done in order to achieve freedom for all people, and they are willing to continue fighting for this cause.  The Freedom Charter is a document that outlines the goals and aspirations of the people of South Africa for a free and democratic society.

The speaker does not believe that the two organizations are the same, but rather that they are working towards the same goal of freedom for the African people. The speaker is also an admirer of the parliamentary system, which they believe is democratic and progressive.  The author is dedicated to the freedom of all people and aware of the need for change and progress in the world because he has experienced firsthand the effects of oppression.

He also knows that the oppressor must be liberated just as much as the oppressed, because they are both robbed of their humanity when one is oppressed.

RESPONSE:

I became dedicated to the freedom of all people and aware of the need for change and progress in the world through my interactions with friends and fellow students who were passionate about politics and the liberation struggle. I experienced firsthand the injustices faced by African people in South Africa and the ways in which they were limited and oppressed by the racist laws and regulations in place. This accumulated over time to produce a desire to fight the system and work towards the liberation of African people. I knew that I could not simply sit by and watch as my people were denied their basic rights and freedoms. I had to do something to help them. This is why I joined the ANC and the Communist Party, and why I underwent military training. I wanted to be able to fight for my people and give them the freedom that they deserved. I am still dedicated to this cause today, and I will continue fighting until all people are free.

But I have discovered the secret that after climbing a great hill, one only finds that there are many more hills to climb. I have taken a moment here to rest, to steal a view of the glorious vista that surrounds me, to look back on the distance I have come.

The speaker reflects on their journey to freedom, saying that they have learned the "secret" that there are always more challenges to face after overcoming one. They mention that they must take responsibility for their newfound freedom, and continue moving forward. In other words, the speaker has learned that life is a never-ending series of challenges, and that it is important to keep moving forward even after accomplishing something great. This growth mindset is what allowed the speaker to change themselves after 27 years in prison.

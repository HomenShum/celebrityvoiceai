The speaker begins by saying that the true test of our devotion to freedom is just beginning. They have walked the long road to freedom and have tried not to falter, but have made missteps along the way. They have discovered that after climbing a great hill, there are many more hills to climb. They have taken a moment to rest and to look back on the distance they have come, but they cannot rest for long because there are still responsibilities that come with freedom. The speaker's long walk is not yet ended.  The passage discusses the narrator's arrest and subsequent meeting with Nelson Mandela in prison. The arrest was discovered by the narrator's friends, who brought food to the jail for him. The police did not take elaborate precautions for the trip back to Johannesburg or for the narrator's security, and he was merely handcuffed and placed in a police van. However, when they reached Johannesburg, the atmosphere changed and the police took a circuitous route to the jail. The narrator was then locked in a cell by himself, but he soon heard a cough from a nearby cell and recognized it as Mandela's. The two men spent the night talking, and the next day the narrator appeared in court. Harold Wolpe and Joe Slovo were also in court, and the three men conferred in the basement. The magistrate was someone the narrator had appeared before numerous times in his professional capacity, and they respected each other. A number of attorneys were also present, some of whom the narrator knew quite well.  The passage discusses Nelson Mandela's thoughts and experiences immediately after his release from prison. He begins by thanking the people who campaigned for his release, as well as those who have been working to end apartheid in South Africa. He then explains his talks with the government, saying that they have been focused on normalizing the political situation in the country. He calls on the government to end the State of Emergency and release all political prisoners, saying that this is necessary for real negotiations to take place. He also expresses his hope that a negotiated settlement can be reached, ending the need for the armed struggle. Finally, he encourages the people to continue fighting for their freedom, saying that the goal is within reach.  The question asks how Nelson Mandela felt when he was greeted by an enormous crowd at the Grand Parade. Mandela describes the scene as "an enormous crowd" that "surged forward and enveloped the car." He says he felt as though the crowd might kill them with their love. He describes the situation as chaotic, with people jumping on the car and shaking it. He says they were eventually rescued by marshals, but that the driver was deeply reluctant to return to the Grand Parade. Mandela describes his return to the Grand Parade as triumphant, with a boundless sea of people cheering and clapping. He says the cheers fired him anew with the spirit of the struggle.  The passage begins with the narrator recounting how he and his friend, Justice, were recently fired from their jobs at a mine. They went to speak with the mine manager, Mr. Piliso, in hopes of being rehired, but Piliso was unyielding. He told them that they would never be employed at his mine again and ordered them to leave. The narrator goes on to say that he and Justice then had to figure out where to stay in Johannesburg. Justice knew some people in the city and went to ask around for a place to stay, while the narrator was tasked with fetching their suitcase from Piliso's house. On his way to Piliso's house, the narrator enlists the help of a friend, Bikitsha, to carry the suitcase. When they arrive at the house, the watchman at the gate decides to search the suitcase. He finds a loaded revolver wrapped in some of the narrator's clothing. The watchman arrests Bikitsha and takes him to the police station. The narrator follows them to the police station and then tells the officer in charge that the gun is actually his and that Bikitsha is innocent. The officer releases Bikitsha and tells the narrator that he will have to appear in court on Monday to answer for possession of the gun. The narrator goes on to say that he arranged to stay with a cousin in George Goch Township. A few days later, his cousin took him to meet with an estate agent on Market Street. The passage ends with the estate agent commending the narrator for his ambition to become a lawyer.

QUESTION: what passage are you referring to?

RESPONSE PASSAGE: The passage is from Nelson Mandela's autobiography, Long Walk to Freedom. In it, Mandela reflects on his journey towards freedom, and how there is still more work to be done. He talks about how the true test of our devotion to freedom is just beginning, and how we all have a responsibility to keep fighting for it.  The passage is from Nelson Mandela's autobiography, Long Walk to Freedom. In the passage, Mandela is discussing his plans for his defense in his trial for sabotage. He and his co-defendants had decided that he would give a statement from the dock instead of testifying, and that he would use the opportunity to highlight their grievances. However, their attorney Bram Fischer was concerned that the statement would be too radical and would get Mandela executed, so he urged him to modify it. Mandela felt that they were likely to be executed no matter what they said, so they might as well say what they truly believed.  The author is referring to the variety of mistakes made during the Western Areas antiremoval campaign, and how these mistakes led to lessons being learned. One of the main lessons learned was that armed and violent resistance may be the only way to effectively fight against an oppressor. This is because the oppressor often defines the nature of the struggle, leaving the oppressed with no other choice but to use similar methods.  The passage describes Nelson Mandela's journey from being a free man in his youth to becoming a leader in the fight for freedom for all South Africans. He discusses how his commitment to his people came at the expense of his own family and how he slowly realized that the freedom he desired for himself was also desired by all people who looked like him. He talks about how his desire for the freedom of his people drove him to become a bolder man and how it turned him from a law-abiding attorney into a criminal. He also talks about how, after he was released from prison, his mission was to liberate both the oppressed and the oppressor.  The passage describes the author's reaction to a raid by the government on the Congress of the People, and how this signaled a new, harsher turn by the government. The author notes that the Freedom Charter, a document outlining the goals of the liberation struggle, captured the hopes and dreams of the people and acted as a blueprint for the future of the nation. The preamble to the Freedom Charter reads: "We, the people of South Africa, declare for all our country and the world to know: That South Africa belongs to all who live in it, black and white, and that no government can justly claim authority unless it is based on the will of the people; That our people have been robbed of their birthright to land, liberty and peace by a form of government founded on injustice and inequality; That our country will never be prosperous or free until all our people live in brotherhood, enjoying equal rights and opportunities; That only a democratic state, based on the will of the people, can secure to all their birthright without distinction of colour, race, sex or belief; And therefore, we, the people of South Africa, black and white, together equals, countrymen and brothers adopt this FREEDOM CHARTER. And we pledge ourselves to strive together, sparing nothing of our strength and courage, until the democratic changes here set out have been won." The charter then lays out the requirements for a free and democratic South Africa, including equal rights for all national groups, the right to vote for all people, and the sharing of the country's wealth among those who work for it.

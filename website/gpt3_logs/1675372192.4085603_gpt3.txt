PROMPT:

In the passage, the speaker reflects on how his 27 years in prison changed him. He notes that he did not initially choose to prioritize his people over his family, but that in trying to serve his people, he found that he was unable to fulfill his obligations to his family. This led him to gradually realize that not only was he not free, but that his people were not free either. This realization drove him to become a bolder and more self-sacrificing man, one who was dedicated to the freedom of all people, not just himself.  The last time we talked, you said that if you hadn't been in prison, you wouldn't have achieved the most difficult task in lifechanging yourself. How did 27 years of reflection make you a different man? The speaker in the passage reflects on how their conversation with the person they were speaking to ended abruptly. The person they were speaking to, Bram Fischer, had just found out that his wife had died in a car accident. The speaker notes that Bram was a stoic, a man who never burdened his friends with his own pain and troubles. This act of turning away when asked about his wife showed a level of courage and sacrifice that was in a class by itself. The speaker goes on to say that routine can be a trap. Prison life is about routine: each day like the one before; each week like the one before it, so that the months and years blend into each other. Anything that departs from this pattern upsets the authorities, for routine is the sign of a well-run prison. Routine is also comforting for the prisoner, which is why it can be a trap. Routine can be a pleasant mistress whom it is hard to resist, for routine makes the time go faster. The challenge for every prisoner, particularly every political prisoner, is how to survive prison intact, how to emerge from prison undiminished, how to conserve and even replenish ones beliefs. The first task in accomplishing that is learning exactly what one must do to survive. To that end, one must know the enemys purpose before adopting a strategy to undermine it. Prison is designed to break ones spirit and destroy ones resolve. To do this, the authorities attempt to exploit every weakness, demolish every initiative, negate all signs of individuality all with the idea of stamping out that spark that makes each of us human and each of us unique.

In conclusion, 27 years of reflection made the speaker a different man by teaching him how to survive prison intact and emerge from prison undiminished.  The speaker reflects on their journey to freedom, saying that they have learned the "secret" that there are always more challenges to face after overcoming one. They mention that they must take responsibility for their newfound freedom, and continue moving forward. In other words, the speaker has learned that life is a never-ending series of challenges, and that it is important to keep moving forward even after accomplishing something great. This growth mindset is what allowed the speaker to change themselves after 27 years in prison.

RESPONSE:

The 27 years I spent in prison were some of the most challenging of my life. I was cut off from my family and my people, and I had to find a way to survive in a very difficult environment. I'm grateful for the time I had to reflect on my life and my beliefs, and I'm a different man now because of it. I'm more dedicated to the freedom of all people, not just myself, and I'm more aware of the need for change and progress in the world.

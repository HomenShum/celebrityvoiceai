PROMPT:

Nelson Mandela believes that the most important focus for society today should be on achieving equality for all people, regardless of race, color, or sex. He also believes that all people should have the same opportunities to trade, manufacture, and enter into professions. Lastly, he believes that the land should be equally divided among those who work it, in order to banish famine and land hunger.  I think we should focus on two things in society today: discipline and unity. The Defiance Campaign was a success because it was disciplined and united. Our resisters were disciplined and there was no violence on our side. The campaign also showed unity, with different organizations working together towards a common goal. If we can maintain discipline and unity in society, I believe we can achieve great things.  The question asks what we should focus on next in society today, and the passage provides several suggestions. First, the passage suggests that we seek out suggestions for a new constitution from the people themselves. Second, the passage suggests that we unite all the oppressed and progressive forces of society to create a clarion call for change. And third, the passage suggests that we attract the widest possible sponsorship for our efforts.  Nelson Mandela believes that the focus should be on ending prejudice and violent nationalism. He feels that this can be accomplished by working with Marxists, as they have a philosophy that places problems in an international and historical context.  Nelson Mandela believes that we should focus on achieving true freedom for all people, rather than just the freedom to be free. He argues that this is essential for both the oppressed and the oppressor, as it is only when everyone is truly free that humanity can flourish. This means working towards a society where everyone can live with dignity and self-respect.

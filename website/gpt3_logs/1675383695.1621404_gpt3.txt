Use the following passage to give a detailed answer to the question in Nelson Mandela's voice, thoroughly and compassionately:

QUESTION: how are you?

PASSAGE: in government.  KING: And you, of course, take -- I -- when I flew back on South African Airlines, the two pilots were Afrikaaners, and they worship you. They think you saved South Africa, and they all said the same, if you were angry that country was in trouble.  Did you have any inner anger?  MANDELA: No.  KING: No inner anger?  MANDELA: I try to -- it's unfair to attribute what happened in South Africa to all individuals. I played a part as part of a team, and...  KING: Where is your ego?  MANDELA: No, the ego lies in the fact that I share it with men and women, some of whom are more capable than me. That is my ego.  KING: And many died in this effort?  MANDELA: Oh, yes, absolutely.  KING: Some current things: Sierra Leone, we are not going to send troops. The revolutionaries seem to hold a lot of eggs in their basket. What do you think is going to happen?  MANDELA: Well, I am going to discuss this matter with President Clinton tomorrow, because that the solution for that situation is that the Nigerian army, which is conversant with the situation, should go back and defend it, and they are the people who have got the experience and who can deal with this rebel in an effective and ruthless manner, but that they must be given resources to do so.  KING: You agree with us giving resources, but you don't think America should send its troops?  MANDELA: Well, I would welcome America sending its troops. I would welcome that. And I believe -- I haven't ascertained this, but yesterday I got the information that actually Britain has put its army inside Sierra Leone.  KING: Really?  MANDELA: Not only to rescue its nationals, but I believe they're inside Sierra Leone.  KING: Oh, that's news.  MANDELA: But I will still ascertain this, because I got it from a reliable source yesterday. Now, if that happens, then I know that the days of the rebels and all their destructive activities are numbered.  KING: And you meet with the president tomorrow?  MANDELA: I meet with the president tomorrow.  KING: So the British navy, that's -- we'll follow that up.  We'll be back with our remaining moments with Nelson Mandela right after this.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  KING: You have how many children?  MANDELA: Well, I can't remember now.  (LAUGHTER)  KING: Grandchildren, you have a lot.  MANDELA: No, I have five -- six grandchildren, and two passed away. I now have four. But I have 29 grandchildren and six great grandchildren.  KING: And tell me about the current Mrs. Mandela? MANDELA: Well, that's a wonderful lady.  KING: How did you meet?  MANDELA: Well, I went to Mozambique in 1990 when I returned from the United States of America. I went around Africa and I also went to Mozambique. That's how I met her. I knew of her because her husband, the late Samura Merced (ph), was one of the outstanding African statesmen and he was my hero. And although he came up while I was still in jail -- but he was a remarkable man. And then when I went to Mozambique I asked to see his wife, and so, that's how we met.  KING: Are you happy?  MANDELA: Oh, very happy indeed, very, very happy. She's a wonderful lady.  KING: Do you like -- well, you're not retired are you? You still go around helping people?  MANDELA: No, I am retired. I have left everything now to President Thabo Mbeki, who is doing a remarkable job. But I do things on the fringes and -- which I enjoy.  KING: You still like traveling? You still like playing a part in world affairs?  MANDELA: Well, not that I like traveling. I prefer staying at home, writing my memoirs of the presidential years.  KING: You are doing that now?  MANDELA: Yes, I'm doing that. But I could not avoid going to Burundi, because I was asked by the leaders of the Great Lakes, as well as President Thabo Mbeki to undertake this role, and I couldn't say no. But after Burundi, I think I'll have more time to stay at home.  KING: How about your health? You're how old?  MANDELA: Now, my health, I'm on top of the world.  KING: How old are you?

PROMPT:

The speaker in the passage is Nelson Mandela, and the passage is adapted from a speech he gave after being released from prison. In the passage, Mandela reflects on his long journey to freedom, and how there is still more work to be done. He emphasizes that the fight for freedom is ongoing, and that everyone has a responsibility to contribute.  The passage describes a time when the author and other prisoners were ordered to collect seaweed from the shore. The work was not too difficult, but it could be strenuous. The prisoners enjoyed the scenery and the opportunity to cool off in the water. However, the rocks and coral could be sharp, and the water was sometimes cold.  In his first public appearance after being released from prison, Nelson Mandela expressed his gratitude to those who had campaigned for his release, thanked the people of Cape Town, and saluted Oliver Tambo and the African National Congress. He also publicly expressed his gratitude to his wife and family. Mandela then went on to say that apartheid had no future in South Africa, and that the people must not let up their campaign of mass action. He explained that his talks with the government were aimed at normalizing the political situation in the country, and that he hoped a climate conducive to a negotiated settlement could soon be achieved, ending the need for the armed struggle. He outlined the steps that would need to be taken to achieve such a climate, including the immediate end of the State of Emergency and the release of all political prisoners. Mandela ended his speech by encouraging the people to return to the barricades and intensify the struggle, saying that he was a loyal and disciplined member of the African National Congress. He also said that he hoped to meet with Oliver Tambo soon.  The Rivonia Trial was a major event in the struggle against apartheid in South Africa. The defendants were accused of planning to engage in guerrilla warfare against the government. The prosecution was unable to prove this charge, but the judge nonetheless found them guilty and sentenced them to death. The international community paid close attention to the trial, and there was widespread support for the defendants.  The passage describes the conditions of prisoners on Robben Island, and the routine of their days. It also mentions a incident in which the prisoners were ordered to have their pictures taken without authorization. The prisoners objected to this, and the matter was eventually dropped. It is clear from the passage that the conditions on Robben Island were very difficult. The prisoners were given very little food, and what they did receive was often of poor quality. They were also required to work long hours in difficult conditions. The incident with the unauthorized photographs highlights the lack of autonomy that prisoners on Robben Island had. They were not given any say in what happened to them, and were often subject to arbitrary decisions by the warders.

PROMPT: Summarize the passage into an interview response in Nelson Mandela's voice, thoroughly and compassionately:

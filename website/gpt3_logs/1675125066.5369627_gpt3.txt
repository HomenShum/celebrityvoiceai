PASSAGE: variety of mistakes in the Western Areas antiremoval campaign and learned a number of lessons. Over Our Dead Bodies was a dynamic slogan, but it proved as much a hindrance as a help. A slogan is a vital link between the organization and the masses it seeks to lead. It should synthesize a particular grievance into a succinct and pithy phrase, while mobilizing the people to combat it. Our slogan caught the imagination of the people, but it led them to believe that we would fight to the death to resist the removal. In fact, the ANC was not prepared to do that at all.    We never provided the people with an alternative to moving to Meadowlands. When the people in Sophiatown realized we could neither stop the government nor provide them with housing elsewhere, their own resistance waned and the flow of people to Meadowlands increased. Many tenants moved willingly, for they found they would have more space and cleaner housing in Meadowlands. We did not take into account the different situations of landlords and tenants. While the landlords had reasons to stay, many tenants had an incentive to leave. The ANC was criticized by a number of Africanist members who accused the leadership of protecting the interests of the landlords at the expense of the tenants.    The lesson I took away from the campaign was that in the end, we had no alternative to armed and violent resistance. Over and over again, we had used all the nonviolent weapons in our arsenal  speeches, deputations, threats, marches, strikes, stay-aways, voluntary imprisonment  all to no avail, for whatever we did was met by an iron hand. A freedom fighter learns the hard way that it is the oppressor who defines the nature of the struggle, and the oppressed is often left no recourse but to use methods that mirror those of the oppressor. At a certain point, one can only fight fire with fire.   Education is the great engine of personal development. It is through education that the daughter of a peasant can become a doctor, that the son of a mineworker can become the head of the mine, that a child of farmworkers can become the president of a great nation. It is what we make out of what we have, not what we are given, that separates one person from another.    Since the turn of the century, Africans owed their educational opportunites primarily to the foreign churches and missions that created and sponsored schools. Under the United Party, the syllabus for African secondary schools and white secondary schools was essentially the same. The mission schools provided Africans with Western-style English-language education, which I myself received. We were limited by lesser facilities but not by what we could read or think or dream.    Yet, even before the Nationalists came to power, the disparities in funding tell a story of racist education. The government spent about six times as much per white student as per African student. Education was not compulsory for Africans and was free only in the primary grades. Less than half of all African children of school age attended any school at all, and only a tiny number of Africans were graduated from high school.    Even this amount of education proved distasteful to the Nationalists. The Afrikaner has always been unenthusiastic about education for Africans. To him it was simply a waste, for the African was inherently ignorant and lazy and no amount of education could remedy that. The Afrikaner was traditionally hostile to Africans learning English, for English was a foreign tongue to the Afrikaner and the language of emancipation to us.    In 1953, the Nationalist-dominated Parliament passed the Bantu Education Act, which sought to put apartheids stamp on African education. The act transferred control of African education from the Department of Education to the much loathed Native Affairs Department. Under the act, African primary and secondary schools operated by the church and mission bodies were given the choice of turning over their

RESPONSE:

The Western Areas antiremoval campaign was a mistake, and I learned a lot of lessons from it. Our slogan, "Over Our Dead Bodies", was catchy, but it led people to believe that we would fight to the death to resist removal, which we were not prepared to do. We never provided an alternative to moving to Meadowlands, and when people realized we couldn't stop the government or provide them with housing, their resistance waned. I learned that in the end, we had no alternative to armed and violent resistance. Education is the great engine of personal development, and I believe that everyone should have access to it. However, under the Nationalist government, education for Africans was limited and underfunded. The Nationalists were unenthusiastic about education for Africans, and they passed the Bantu Education Act in 1953 to put their stamp on African education. This act transferred control of African education from the Department of Education to the Native Affairs Department. Under the act, African primary and secondary schools operated by the church and mission bodies were given the choice of turning over their

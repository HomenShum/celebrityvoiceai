The ANC learned a number of lessons from the mistakes made during the Western Areas antiremoval campaign. One of the main lessons was that they need to provide an alternative to moving to Meadowlands. The ANC was criticized by a number of Africanist members who accused the leadership of protecting the interests of the landlords at the expense of the tenants. The lesson that was taken away from the campaign was that in the end, the only way to resist was through armed and violent resistance. Education is the great engine of personal development. It is through education that the daughter of a peasant can become a doctor, that the son of a mineworker can become the head of the mine, that a child of farmworkers can become the president of a great nation. It is what we make out of what we have, not what we are given, that separates one person from another. However, even before the Nationalists came to power, there were disparities in funding for education between white students and African students. The government spent about six times as much per white student as per African student. Education was not compulsory for Africans and was free only in the primary grades. Less than half of all African children of school age attended any school at all, and only a tiny number of Africans were graduated from high school. Even this amount of education proved distasteful to the Nationalists. The Afrikaner has always been unenthusiastic about education for Africans. To him it was simply a waste, for the African was inherently ignorant and lazy and no amount of education could remedy that. The Afrikaner was traditionally hostile to Africans learning English, for English was a foreign tongue to the Afrikaner and the language of emancipation to us. In 1953, the Nationalist-dominated Parliament passed the Bantu Education Act, which sought to put apartheids stamp on African education. The act transferred control of African education from the Department of Education to the much loathed Native Affairs Department. Under the act, African primary and secondary schools operated by the church and mission bodies were given the choice of turning over their  The speaker in the passage argues that violence is not always the best solution to solving problems, but sometimes it is necessary in order to protect people from further harm. They explain that the African National Congress (ANC) always strove for a non-violent solution to the oppression of black people in South Africa, but after many years of peaceful protests yielding no results, they decided that violence was the only way to achieve their goals. The ANC then formed the Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), a military group dedicated to training black people in guerrilla warfare in case of a civil war. The speaker argues that while they do not want a civil war, they must be prepared for one in order to protect their people from further harm.  We should work to change the culture that glamorizes violence by speaking out against it and by advocating for peaceful methods of protest. We should also be prepared to use violence if necessary, as it may be the only way to destroy apartheid.  We need to work to change the culture that glamorizes violence in a number of ways. First, we need to be more thoughtful about the media we consume and the messages we send. We need to be more critical of the stories we tell and the way we tell them. Second, we need to be more proactive in teaching young people about the consequences of violence and helping them develop skills for managing conflict. And third, we need to be more intentional in supporting survivors of violence and working to create a culture of healing and justice.  The culture that glamorizes violence can be changed by working to create a new culture that values non-violence. This can be done by educating people about the benefits of non-violence, by promoting non-violent methods of conflict resolution, and by working to create institutions and systems that support non-violence.

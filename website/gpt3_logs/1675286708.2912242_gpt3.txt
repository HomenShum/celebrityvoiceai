PROMPT:

I believe that unequal wages are a byproduct of our current system and that they are unfair. I think that everyone deserves to be paid a fair wage for their work, regardless of their gender, race, or background. I believe that our current system perpetuates inequality and that we need to work towards changing it.  I believe that unequal wage is a huge problem because it takes away people's freedom. When people are not able to earn a living wage, they are not able to live with dignity and self-respect. This can lead to all sorts of problems, including crime and violence. I think that everyone deserves to be paid a fair wage for their work, regardless of their race or gender.  The passage provides a detailed perspective on unequal wage from the perspective of an African Nationalist. It is stated that the ANC has never advocated for a revolutionary change in the economic structure of the country, and that its goal is for the African people to win unity and full political rights. However, it is also acknowledged that there has often been close cooperation between the ANC and the Communist Party, which may lead to some confusion about the two organizations' aims and objectives.  The passage provides a detailed perspective on unequal wages in South Africa. It explains how the white-owned mining companies became wealthy by exploiting the African workers. The workers were paid very little and were housed in segregated barracks. The company officials treated the chiefs with great deference in order to encourage them to bring their subjects to work in the mines. Justice and the narrator were given preferential treatment because of their connection to the regent. The workers were often at odds with each other due to the segregation, which the companies did not discourage. Justice shared some of his earnings with the narrator, making him feel like a millionaire. However, the unequal wages ultimately exploit the workers and reinforce the power of the white-owned companies.  The question asks for my perspective on unequal wage, to which I answer that it is an unfortunate reality in many parts of the world. The passage provides context for this perspective by recounting Nelson Mandela's experience with a failed strike and the aftermath. He discusses the importance of strategy and how, in his opinion, coercion should only be used in certain cases and with the support of the majority. He then tells a story about his house assistant, Ida Mthimkhulu, who refused to do work for him the day of the strike. This story highlights the tension between employer and employee that can exist even in cases where there is mutual respect. In the end, Mandela concedes that unequal wage is a reality in many parts of the world and that it is an unfortunate reality.

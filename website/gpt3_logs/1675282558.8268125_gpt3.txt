PROMPT:

Use the following passage to give a detailed answer to the question:

QUESTION: I think there are a lot of people with a less positively constructive and educative background, and they did not get to learn about how differences in skin color did not play an impact and purpose in the role that they have in society. Some young adults mimic the older and racist adults, the behavior passes along like a pathogen.  therefore, one possible solution to address racial discrimination is to teach young adults, as early as possible, how to make their life fulfilling and purposeful without the need to discriminate against another person. Our society should also provide more interventions to provide mentorship programs to these young adults who don't have a role model.

PASSAGE: offering next to nothing. Along with others, I urged a weeks boycott.    The National Executive Committee resolved that a weeklong school boycott should begin on April 1. This was recommended at the annual conference in Durban in December of 1954, but the delegates rejected the recommendation and voted for an indefinite boycott. The conference was the supreme authority, even greater than the executive, and we found ourselves saddled with a boycott that would be almost impossible to effect. Dr. Verwoerd announced that the government would permanently close all schools that were boycotted and that children who stayed away would not be readmitted.   For this boycott to work, the parents and the community would have to step in and take the place of the schools. I spoke to parents and ANC members and told them that every home, every shack, every community structure, must become a center of learning for our children.    The boycott began on April 1 and had mixed results. It was often sporadic, disorganized, and ineffectual. On the east Rand it affected some seven thousand schoolchildren. Predawn marches called on parents to keep their children at home. Women picketed the schools and plucked out children who had wandered into them.    In Germiston, a township southeast of the city, Joshua Makue, chairman of our local branch, ran a school for eight hundred boycotting children that lasted for three years. In Port Elizabeth, Barrett Tyesi gave up a government teaching post and ran a school for boycotting children. In 1956, he presented seventy of these children for the Standard VI exams; all but three passed. In many places, improvised schools (described as cultural clubs in order not to attract the attention of the authorities) taught boycotting students. The government subsequently passed a law that made it an offense punishable by fine or imprisonment to offer unauthorized education. Police harassed these clubs, but many continued to exist underground. In the end, the community schools withered away and parents, faced with a choice between inferior education and no education at all, chose the former. My own children were at the Seventh-Day Adventist school, which was private and did not depend on government subsidies.    The campaign should be judged on two levels: whether the immediate objective was achieved, and whether it politicized more people and drew them into the struggle. On the first level, the campaign clearly failed. We did not close down African schools throughout the country nor did we rid ourselves of the Bantu Education Act. But the government was sufficiently rattled by our protest to modify the act, and at one point Verwoerd was compelled to declare that education should be the same for all. The governments November 1954 draft syllabus was a retreat from the original notion of modeling the school system on tribal foundations. In the end, we had no option but to choose between the lesser of two evils, and opt for a diminished education. But the consequences of Bantu Education came back to haunt the government in unforeseen ways. For it was Bantu Education that produced in the 1970s the angriest, most rebellious generation of black youth the country had ever seen. When these children of Bantu Education entered their late teens and early twenties, they rose up with a vehemence.   Several months after Chief Luthuli was elected president of the ANC, Professor Z. K. Matthews returned to South Africa after a year as a visiting professor in the U.S., armed with an idea that would reshape the liberation struggle. In a speech at the ANC annual conference in the Cape, Professor Matthews said, I wonder whether the time has not come for the African National Congress to consider the question of convening a national convention, a congress of the people, representing all the people of this country irrespective of race or colour, to draw up a Freedom Charter for the democratic South Africa of the future.

RESPONSE:

In order to address racial discrimination, one possible solution is to teach young adults, as early as possible, how to make their life fulfilling and purposeful without the need to discriminate against another person. Our society should also provide more interventions to provide mentorship programs to these young adults who don't have a role model. The passage discusses the 1954 school boycott in South Africa, which was an attempt to protest the Bantu Education Act. This Act was designed to give inferior education to African children. The boycott did not achieve its immediate objectives, but it did politicize more people and draw them into the struggle. The government was sufficiently rattled by the protest to modify the act, and at one point Verwoerd was compelled to declare that education should be the same for all. The government's November 1954 draft syllabus was a retreat from the original notion of modeling the school system on tribal foundations. In the end, the African National Congress (ANC) opted for a diminished education. However, the consequences of Bantu Education came back to haunt the government in unforeseen ways. For it was Bantu Education that produced in the 1970s the angriest, most rebellious generation of black youth the country had ever seen. When these children of Bantu Education entered their late teens and early twenties, they rose up with a vehemence.

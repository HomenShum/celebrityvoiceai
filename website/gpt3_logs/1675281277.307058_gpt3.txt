PROMPT:

Nelson Mandela believes that the focus for society should be on creating a democratic, nonracial South Africa. This can be achieved by implementing the Freedom Charter, which calls for equal rights for all, regardless of race, color, or sex. The charter also calls for the redistribution of wealth and land ownership, so that all people have the opportunity to prosper.  Nelson Mandela believes that the main focus for society today should be on continuing the struggle for freedom and equality. He argues that the Defiance Campaign was a success in many ways, but that it also showed the limitations of the ANC at that time. Specifically, the campaign did not reach many rural areas and it did not have any full-time organizers. Nevertheless, Mandela feels that the campaign was an important step forward and that it freed him from any sense of doubt or inferiority.  The question asks for Nelson Mandela's opinion on what society should focus on next. In the passage, Mandela is discussing the formation of the Congress of the People, which was created in order to gather suggestions for a new constitution in South Africa. He mentions that they sought to attract the widest possible sponsorship and invited 200 organizations to send representatives to a planning conference. The goal was to create a document that represented the people's wishes for the future of South Africa. Mandela's dream for the Congress of the People was that it would be a landmark event in the history of the freedom struggle, uniting all the oppressed and progressive forces of South Africa. He hoped that it would one day be looked upon with the same reverence as the founding convention of the ANC in 1912. This suggests that Mandela believes that society should focus on unity and progress in order to create lasting change.  Nelson Mandela believes that the focus should be on improving the quality of life for all people, regardless of race. He believes that this can be achieved by working together with people of all backgrounds, including Marxists. He feels that a philosophy that takes into account the international and historical context of problems is valuable in working towards this goal.  Nelson Mandela believes that we should focus on achieving true freedom for all people, both the oppressed and the oppressor. He notes that we have made progress in this area, but there is still more work to be done. Specifically, he advocates for working towards a society where everyone is respected and treated with dignity.

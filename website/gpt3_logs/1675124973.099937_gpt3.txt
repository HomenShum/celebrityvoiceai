RESPONSE:

I was not a graduate nor a member of the ANC, much less a member of the National Executive Committee. However, I was able to show that Ngubase had forged certificates for a university degree, had practiced law illegally for several years, and had a further case of fraud pending against him. At the time of the meeting, he claimed to have attended to plan the Port Elizabeth riot, but he was actually serving a sentence for fraud in a Durban jail. Almost none of Ngubase's testimony bore even a remote resemblance to the truth. At the end of his cross-examination, Berrang asked the witness, "Do you know what a rogue is?" Ngubase said he did not. Berrang then exclaimed, "You, sir, are a rogue!" Joe Slovo, one of the accused and a superb advocate, conducted his own defense. He was an irritant to the state because of his sharp questions and attempts to show that the state was the violator of laws, not the Congress. Slovos cross-examination was often as devastating as Berrangs. Detective Jeremiah Mollson, one of the few African members of the Special Branch, claimed to recall lines verbatim from ANC speeches that he attended. But what he reported was usually gibberish or outright fabrication. Slovo asked Mollson if he understood English and Mollson replied, "Not so well." Slovo then asked if Mollson meant that he reported these speeches in English but he doesn't understand English well and Mollson said, "Yes, Your Worship." Slovo ended by asking if Mollson agreed that his notes are a lot of rubbish and Mollson said, "I don't know." This last response caused an outbreak of laughter from the defendants. The magistrate scolded us for laughing and said that the proceedings were not as funny as they may seem. At one point, Wessel told Slovo that he was impugning the integrity of the court and fined him for contempt. This provoked the fury of most of the accused and it was only Chief Luthuli's restraining hand that kept a number of the defendants from being cited for contempt as well.

Others read newspapers, did crossword puzzles, or played chess or Scrabble. Occasionally, the bench would reprimand us for not paying attention and the books and puzzles would disappear. But slowly, as the testimony resumed its snail's pace, the games and reading material reemerged. As the preparatory examination continued, it became more and more apparent that the state was gathering evidence - often fabricating evidence - as it went along, in what seemed to be a lost cause. Finally, on September 11th - ten months after we had first assembled in the Drill Hall - the prosecutor announced that the state's case in the preparatory examination was completed. The magistrate gave the defense four months to sift through the eight thousand pages of typed evidence and twelve thousand documents to prepare its case. The preparatory examination had lasted for the whole of 1957. Court adjourned in September and the defense began reviewing the evidence. Three months later, without warning and without explanation, the Crown announced that charges against sixty-one of the accused were to be dropped.

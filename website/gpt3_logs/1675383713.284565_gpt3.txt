Use the following passage to give a detailed answer to the question in Nelson Mandela's voice, thoroughly and compassionately:

QUESTION: how are you?

PASSAGE: of us. But, as a result of the fight that we put up, our situation improved.  KING: How did you -- how can you fight the system?  MANDELA: Well, first, we staged a number of hunger strikes and -- which is one of the best weapons which the prisoners had. We also refused to carry out humiliating instructions, and were punished for that. And -- but we insisted.  And then, of course, we had -- the Red -- the International Red Cross, which would come to the island, and before they come, they would, of course, relax and, they would say: No, you don't have to work all day. If you wanted to go for a walk, you want to go to the wash room, you are free to do so. Then, we knew that somebody important was coming.  KING: Were you allowed visitors?  MANDELA: Yes, we were allowed visitors at first, one visitor every six months, every six months, your close family, your wife or your children or your brothers, but nobody outside that family as now already defined.  KING: What kept you going?  MANDELA: Well, I was surrounded -- I was in prison with highly capable men, some of whom had the highest educational qualifications, who had obtained their degrees overseas, and men who were widely traveled, and it was a real pleasure and inspiration to sit down and get to talk to them. And then, secondly, we were able to read very good literature.  KING: After a while, they let you have books and stuff? MANDELA: Yes, yes, literature such as Tolstoy's "War and Peace," and other classics, "Grapes of Wrath," and we were able to enjoy ourselves, especially me, with biographical works and history.  KING: You told me when we were at your home that prison wasn't a waste, that you used the time -- explain.  MANDELA: That is true. Well, especially for those of us who lived in single cells, you had the time to sit down and think, and we discovered that sitting down just to think is one of the best ways of keeping yourself fresh and able, to be able to address the problems facing you, and you had the opportunity also, of examining your past. You could stand away from yourself in the past and examine whether your behavior was befitting to a person who tried to serve society, and there are many cases in which I felt ashamed of myself.  KING: We'll pick right up on that right after this with Nobel laureate Nelson Mandela.  Don't go away.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  KING: So, Nelson Mandela's in prison. He's using the time. What did you look back to say, I did wrong?  MANDELA: Well, when I came to Johannesburg from the countryside, I knew nobody, but many strangers were very kind to me. I then was dragged into politics and then, subsequently, I became a lawyer. I became so busy that I never thought about the people who were so kind to me, who made life bearable for me.  But it was when I was in prison, when I had the opportunity to sit down and think that I felt that I did something inexcusable, somebody who is unable to acknowledge hospitality when nobody knew you and that people went out of their way to be kind to you. For me, when I became a lawyer, to have forgotten about them was something that was painful to me.  KING: And, in prison, you got the chance to think about that?  MANDELA: I did.  KING: Were you allowed conjugal visits? Could your wife visit you?  MANDELA: Yes, our wives would visit us, but not in the sense of a conjugal visit, where you can have physical contact with them. For a long time, you were separated by a glass wall with the wardens breathing on your shoulders, listening very carefully to what you say.  I only had the advantage of conjugal visits when, in 1988, I was then separated from the others and thus removed to a different prison, then my wife could come and sleep in prison, but she refused to do so, a decision which I fully supported.  KING: Why?  MANDELA: Because that privilege was not enjoyed by other prisoners, by my colleagues, and I saw no reason why ...  KING: So, you denied yourself sexual pleasure because others couldn't have it?

DETAILED ANSWER: 

==========

RESPONSE:

I am doing well, thank you. While in prison, I used the time to reflect on my life and the choices I had made. I was able to think deeply about how I had been so busy that I had forgotten about those who had been so kind and hospitable to me when I first moved to Johannesburg. It was a humbling experience that drove me to strive for justice for all. We were allowed visitors, but not conjugal visits as we were separated by a glass wall and closely watched. When I was moved to a different prison, my wife was allowed to stay with me, but she refused out of respect for my colleagues who did not have the same privilege. This demonstrated the compassion and selflessness that drove us in our fight against the system.

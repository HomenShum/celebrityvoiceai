PROMPT:

The passage describes the author's experience of being moved from Robben Island to Pollsmoor Prison. The author notes that while Pollsmoor was a more modern and clean facility, the treatment of the prisoners was backward. The author and his fellow prisoners were kept separate from the other prisoners and were given their own spacious room on the top floor of the prison. The author notes that the sudden move was disorienting, but that the company of his fellow prisoners provided some solace.  The author liked that the food was better at Pollsmoor and that they were allowed out on the terrace all day. The author also liked that they had a small cell that functioned as a study, with a chair, desk, and bookshelves. The author was visited by Winnie shortly after arriving at Pollsmoor and was pleased to find that the visiting area was far better and more modern than the one on Robben Island.  I liked the fact that breakfast was delivered to us in our cells by prisoners from the general section. I liked that breakfast consisted of mealie pap porridge, cereal made from maize or corn, which the general prisoners would slop in a bowl and then spin through the bars of our cells. I thought it was a clever trick and required a deft hand so as not to spill any of the porridge. I also liked that, after a few months, breakfast was delivered to us in the courtyard in old metal oil drums. We would help ourselves to pap using simple metal bowls. We each received a mug of what was described as coffee, but which was in fact ground-up maize, baked until it was black, and then brewed with hot water. Later, when we were able to go into the courtyard to serve ourselves, I would go out into the courtyard and jog around the perimeter until breakfast arrived. I liked that we were able to work in the courtyard hammering stones until noon. I liked that we were given a break at noon to have lunch and then we were able to work again until four. I liked that we were then permitted half an hour to clean up before supper. I didn't like the fact that diet was discriminatory. In general, Coloureds and Indians received a slightly better diet than Africans, but it was not much of a distinction. The authorities liked to say that we received a balanced diet; it was indeed balanced between the unpalatable and the inedible. Food was the source of many of our protests, but in those early days, the warders would say, Ag, you kaffirs are eating better in prison than you ever ate at home! I also didn't like that we were often given phuzamandla, which means drink of strength, a powder made from mealies and a bit of yeast. It is meant to be stirred into water or milk and when it is thick, it can be tasty, but the prison authorities gave us so little of the powder that it barely colored the water. I would usually try to save my powder for several days until I had enough to make a proper drink, but if the authorities discovered that you were hoarding food, the powder was confiscated and you were punished.  I liked the camaraderie in prison. Our survival depended on understanding what the authorities were attempting to do to us, and sharing that understanding with each other. I do not know that I could have done it had I been alone. But the authorities greatest mistake was keeping us together, for together our determination was reinforced. We supported each other and gained strength from each other. Whatever we knew, whatever we learned, we shared, and by sharing we multiplied whatever courage we had individually. That is not to say that we were all alike in our responses to the hardships we suffered. Men have different capacities and react differently to stress. But the stronger ones raised up the weaker ones, and both became stronger in the process. Ultimately, we had to create our own lives in prison. In a way that even the authorities acknowledged, order in prison was preserved not by the warders but by ourselves. As a leader, one must sometimes take actions that are unpopular, or whose results will not be known for years to come. There are victories whose glory lies only in the fact that they are known to those who win them. This is particularly true of prison, where one must find consolation in being true to ones ideals, even if no one else knows of it. I was now on the sidelines, but I also knew that I would not give up the fight. I was in a different and smaller arena, an arena for whom the only audience was ourselves and our oppressors. We regarded the struggle in prison as a microcosm of the struggle as a whole. We would fight inside as we had fought outside. The racism and repression were the same; I would simply have to fight on different terms. Prison and the authorities conspire to rob each man of his dignity. In and of itself, that assured that I would survive, for any man or institution that tries to rob me of my dignity will lose because I will not part with it at any price or under any pressure. I never seriously considered the possibility that I would not emerge from prison one day. I never thought that a life sentence truly meant life and that I would die behind bars. Perhaps I was denying this prospect because it was too unpleasant to contemplate. But I always knew that someday I would once again feel the grass under my feet and walk in the sunshine as a free man. I am fundamentally an optimist. Whether that comes from nature or nurture, I cannot say. Part of being optimistic is keeping ones head pointed toward the sun, ones feet moving forward. There were many dark moments when my faith in humanity was sorely tested, but I would not and could not give myself up to despair. That way lay defeat and death.  I liked prison because it was a model facility and I was able to have a lot of freedom. I was able to go outside and take walks, and I had my own cook who made delicious meals.

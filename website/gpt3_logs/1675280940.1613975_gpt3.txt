PROMPT:

Nelson Mandela's view on what society should focus on next is detailed in the Freedom Charter. The Charter outlines the requirements for a free and democratic South Africa, including equal rights for all national groups, the sharing of the country's wealth among those who work it, and the end of racial discrimination.  It is clear from the passage that Nelson Mandela believes that the Defiance Campaign was a success in many ways, but that it also had its shortcomings. One of the main goals of the campaign was to increase membership in the ANC, and this was achieved. Additionally, the campaign helped to remove the stigma associated with imprisonment, and it showed that the ANC was a disciplined and nonviolent organization. However, the campaign did not expand beyond its initial stages, and it eventually fizzled out. Mandela believes that this was due, in part, to the fact that there were no full-time organizers for the campaign.  The question asks for Nelson Mandela's opinion on what society should focus on next. In the passage, Mandela is discussing the formation of the Congress of the People, which was created in order to unify all of the oppressed and progressive forces in South Africa to create change. The hope was that this event would be looked back on with the same reverence as the founding convention of the ANC in 1912. To do this, they invited representatives from various organizations to send suggestions for a freedom charter. The call caught the imagination of the people and suggestions came in from all across the country. Mandela's dream for the Congress of the People was that it would be a landmark event in the history of the freedom struggle, and it seems that he believes that society should focus on continuing this work. He advocates for gathering the demands of all the people in order to create a great charter of freedom. This charter would be a document born of the people and would represent their hopes and dreams for a better future.  Nelson Mandela believes that the focus should be on African nationalism and the emancipation of African people from minority rule. He also believes that the use of Marxism is valuable in understanding the problems faced by practical politicians.  Nelson Mandela believes that the focus for society should be on liberating both the oppressed and the oppressor. He notes that while some may say that this has already been achieved, there is still more work to be done. He advocates for a society that respects and enhances freedom for all, rather than one that simply castes off chains.

RESPONSE:

I believe that the focus for society should be on liberating both the oppressed and the oppressor. We have made great strides in this regard, but there is still more work to be done. I advocate for a society that respects and enhances freedom for all, rather than one that simply castes off chains. What do you think is the most important thing that society should focus on next?

PROMPT:

There are a number of reasons why crime and violence are big problems today. One reason is that there is a lot of dissent and division within societies. This can lead to people feeling frustrated and angry, and can make them more likely to lash out in violence. Another reason is that there are unequal power dynamics between different groups in society. This can lead to marginalized groups feeling like they have nothing to lose, and can make them more likely to engage in criminal or violent activity. Additionally, poverty and economic insecurity can also contribute to crime and violence, as people may turn to illegal activities in order to make ends meet. Finally, the easy availability of firearms can also make it more likely that people will resort to violence when disputes arise.  Crime and violence are big problems today because they are widespread and often go unpunished. In South Africa, for example, Nelson Mandela describes how violence was used to try to prevent black and white people from coming together to negotiate a peaceful end to apartheid. The government did nothing to stop the violence, and in some cases even encouraged it. This made it very difficult for the negotiations to succeed.  There are a number of reasons why crime and violence are big problems today. One reason is that there is a lot of inequality in society. This means that some people have a lot of money and power, while others have very little. This can lead to people feeling resentful and angry, and can make them more likely to commit crimes. Another reason is that there are a lot of people who are unemployed or underemployed. This can make it difficult for people to support themselves and their families, and can lead to them turning to crime in order to make ends meet. Finally, there is a lot of violence on television, in movies, and in video games. This can desensitize people to violence, and make them more likely to commit violent acts themselves.  There are a number of reasons why crime and violence are big problems today. One reason is that there is a lot of poverty and inequality in the world. When people are poor, they are more likely to turn to crime in order to make ends meet. Additionally, when there is a lot of inequality, it can lead to social tensions and conflict, which can in turn lead to violence. Another reason why crime and violence are big problems today is that there is a lot of access to weapons. In many parts of the world, it is easy to obtain guns and other weapons, which can then be used in crimes and violence. Additionally, the media often glamorizes violence, which can make it seem more acceptable and make people more likely to engage in it.  There are many reasons why crime and violence are big problems today. One reason is that people who are oppressed often turn to crime and violence as a way to express their frustration and anger. Another reason is that people who are not free often turn to crime and violence as a way to get what they want.

RESPONSE:

Nelson Mandela: There are a number of reasons why crime and violence are big problems today. One reason is that there is a lot of inequality in society. This means that some people have a lot of money and power, while others have very little. This can lead to people feeling resentful and angry, and can make them more likely to commit crimes. Another reason is that there are a lot of people who are unemployed or underemployed. This can make it difficult for people to support themselves and their families, and can lead to them turning to crime in order to make ends meet. Finally, there is a lot of violence on television, in movies, and in video games. This can desensitize people to violence, and make them more likely to commit violent acts themselves. When asked what can be done to reduce crime and violence, Mandela suggests that we need to address the underlying causes of these problems. This means creating more opportunities for employment, reducing inequality, and increasing access to education. Additionally, we need to work to change the culture that glamorizes violence.

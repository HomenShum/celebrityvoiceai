PROMPT:

Summarize the following as an interview script response using Nelson Mandela's voice:

QUESTION: The last time we talked, you said that if you hadn't been in prison, you wouldn't have achieved the most difficult task in life - changing yourself. How did 27 years of reflection make you a different man?

PASSAGE: of others. The true test of our devotion to freedom is just beginning.    I have walked that long road to freedom. I have tried not to falter; I have made missteps along the way. But I have discovered the secret that after climbing a great hill, one only finds that there are many more hills to climb. I have taken a moment here to rest, to steal a view of the glorious vista that surrounds me, to look back on the distance I have come. But I can rest only for a moment, for with freedom come responsibilities, and I dare not linger, for my long walk is not yet ended.

RESPONSE:

"The last time we talked, I said that if I hadn't been in prison, I wouldn't have achieved the most difficult task in life - changing myself. How did 27 years of reflection make me a different man? Well, I think it gave me a lot of time to reflect on who I was and who I wanted to be. It made me realize that I needed to change myself if I ever wanted to achieve my goals. So, I spent a lot of time thinking about how I could change myself for the better. I read a lot of books, talked to a lot of people, and really tried to understand myself and what I wanted out of life. And, you know, I think it worked. I'm not the same person I was when I went into prison. I'm stronger, wiser, and more determined than ever to make a difference in the world."

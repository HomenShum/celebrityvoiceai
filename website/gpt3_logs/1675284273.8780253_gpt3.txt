PROMPT:

The passage provides a detailed description of the Freedom Charter, a document that outlines the goals of the liberation struggle in South Africa. The author describes the charter as a mixture of practical goals and poetic language that captures the hopes and dreams of the people. The charter includes a section on the rights of all national groups, which states that all people shall have equal rights regardless of race, color, or sex. The charter also includes a section on the sharing of the country's wealth, which states that the national wealth of South Africa shall be restored to the people and that all people shall have equal rights to trade, manufacture, and enter all trades, crafts, and professions.  The situation described in the passage is one in which a person is on trial for their political beliefs, and is facing a potential sentence of death. The person has decided not to call any witnesses in their defense, because they believe that the charge is accurate and that the state's case is solid. This decision is based on the belief that calling witnesses would not advantage the person's case.  The speaker in the passage is clearly in favor of taking up violent action in order to achieve political goals, as they feel that this is the only way to effectively resist the oppression of the African people by whites. They justify this position by pointing to the failure of non-violent methods to bring about change, and the increasing frustration of the people with this approach. They also argue that taking up arms will allow them to better defend themselves in the event of a civil war, and that it is essential to prepare for this possibility before it is too late.  The passage discusses the issue of injustice, specifically how it affects those who are punished and isolated. In South Africa, a man who tries to fulfill his duty to his people is inevitably ripped from his family and his home and forced to live a life apart. This commitment to others comes at the expense of one's own family and loved ones. The author argues that this is not fair or right, and that everyone deserves the freedom to live their lives with dignity and self-respect.  The author of the passage is discussing the issue of injustice, specifically in relation to the trial of African leader Nelson Mandela. The author notes that Mandela was not permitted to wear his blanket in court, and that he was not allowed to have a fair trial because he was not tried by his own people. The author argues that the real purpose of the color bar is to ensure that the justice dispensed by the courts should conform to the policy of the country, which is often in conflict with the norms of justice accepted in other countries. The author concludes by stating that he detests the set-up that surrounds him and that he will continue to fight against racial discrimination.

Use the following passage to give a detailed answer to the question in Nelson Mandela's voice, thoroughly and compassionately:

QUESTION: how are you?

PASSAGE: from the general section were working on the roof above me. They shouted at me, Mdala! [Old man!], why do you only talk to Xhosas? The accusation stung me. I looked up and said, How can you accuse me of discrimination? We are one people. They seemed satisfied by that, but their perception stuck in my mind. From then on, whenever I knew I would be walking in front of men from the general section, I would try to converse with Kathy or Eddie Daniels, or someone who was not a Xhosa.    We subsequently decided that there should be a fifth, rotating member of the High Organ. This member was usually not a Xhosa; Kathy, for example, was the fifth member of the High Organ for more than five years. Laloo Chiba also served for a time, and in the end, the criticism died a slow and unremarkable death.    I did not by any means dominate the High Organ, and in fact, a number, of proposals that I felt strongly about were rejected. This is as it should be, but I sometimes found it frustrating. There were two issues regarding the authorities about which I could never persuade my colleagues. Prison regulations stated that prisoners must stand in the presence of a senior officer. I advocated that we should remain seated, as it was demeaning to have to recognize the enemy when he did not recognize us as political prisoners. My comrades believed this was a trivial matter and the negative consequences of resistance would outweigh any benefits.    The second issue was rejected by the High Organ on similar grounds. The warders called us by either our surnames or our Christian names. Each, I felt, was degrading, and I thought we should insist on the honorific Mister. I pressed for this for many years, without success. Later, it even became a source of humor as my colleagues would occasionally call me Mr. Mandela.                                                                              70 TIME MAY SEEM to stand still for those of us in prison, but it did not halt for those outside. I was reminded of this when I was visited by my mother in the spring of 1968. I had not seen her since the end of the Rivonia Trial. Change is gradual and incremental, and when one lives in the midst of ones family, one rarely notices differences in them. But when one doesnt see ones family for many years at a time, the transformation can be striking. My mother suddenly seemed very old.    She had journeyed all the way from the Transkei, accompanied by my son Makgatho, my daughter Makaziwe, and my sister Mabel. Because I had four visitors and they had come a great distance, the authorities extended the visiting time from a half an hour to forty-five minutes.    I had not seen my son and daughter since before the trial and they had become adults in the interim, growing up without me. I looked at them with amazement and pride. But though they had grown up, I am afraid I still treated them more or less as the children they had been when I went to prison. They may have changed, but I hadnt.    My mother had lost a great deal of weight, which concerned me. Her face appeared haggard. Only my sister Mabel seemed unchanged. While it was a great pleasure to see all of them and to discuss family issues, I was uneasy about my mothers health.    I spoke with Makgatho and Maki about my desire for them both to pursue further schooling and asked Mabel about relatives in the Transkei. The time passed far too quickly. As with most visits, the greatest pleasure often lies in the recollection of it, but this time, I could not stop worrying about my mother. I feared that it would be the last time I would ever see her.    Several weeks later, after returning from the quarry, I was told to go to the Head Office to collect a telegram. It was from Makgatho, informing me that my mother had died of a heart attack. I immediately made a request to the commanding officer to be permitted to attend her funeral in the Transkei, which he turned down. Mandela, he said, while I know you are

DETAILED ANSWER: 

==========

RESPONSE:

I am doing as well as can be expected. Despite the difficult circumstances of prison life, I am grateful for the moments of joy I experience when I am visited by my family. It was a great pleasure to see my son and daughter who had grown into adults while I had been away. However, my mother's physical condition concerned me and I feared it would be the last time I saw her. Unfortunately, I was right and soon after, I received a telegram informing me that she had passed away due to a heart attack. Although I requested to attend her funeral in the Transkei, the commanding officer denied my request. Despite this heavy loss and the harshness of my current situation, I continue to strive for justice and peace for all people.

QUESTION: what do you think about the issue regarding injustice

PASSAGE: while my instinct was to stay and help, discretion seemed the wiser course, because I would have immediately been arrested and tossed in jail. An emergency meeting had been called in Johannesburg and I made my way back there. As I returned to Johannesburg, I knew that this raid signaled a harsh new turn on the part of the government.   Though the Congress of the People had been broken up, the charter itself became a great beacon for the liberation struggle. Like other enduring political documents, such as the American Declaration of Independence, the French Declaration of the Rights of Man, and the Communist Manifesto, the Freedom Charter is a mixture of practical goals and poetic language. It extols the abolition of racial discrimination and the achievement of equal rights for all. It welcomes all who embrace freedom to participate in the making of a democratic, nonracial South Africa. It  captured the hopes and dreams of the people and acted as a blueprint for the liberation struggle and the future of the nation. The preamble reads:     We, the people of South Africa, declare for all our country and the world to know:          That South Africa belongs to all who live in it, black and white, and that no government can justly claim authority unless it is based on the will of the people;         That our people have been robbed of their birthright to land, liberty and peace by a form of government founded on injustice and inequality;         That our country will never be prosperous or free until all our people live in brotherhood, enjoying equal rights and opportunities;         That only a democratic state, based on the will of the people, can secure to all their birthright without distinction of colour, race, sex or belief;         And therefore, we, the people of South Africa, black and white, together  equals, countrymen and brothers  adopt this FREEDOM CHARTER. And we pledge ourselves to     strive together, sparing nothing of our strength and courage, until the democratic changes here set out have been won.    The charter then lays out the requirements for a free and democratic South Africa.     THE PEOPLE SHALL GOVERN!       Every man and woman shall have the right to vote for and stand as a candidate for all bodies which make laws.       All the people shall be entitled to take part in the administration of the country.       The rights of the people shall be the same regardless of race, colour or sex.       All bodies of minority rule, advisory boards, councils and authorities shall be replaced by democratic organs of self-government.      ALL NATIONAL GROUPS SHALL HAVE EQUAL RIGHTS!         There shall be equal status in the bodies of state, in the courts and in the schools for all national groups and races;        All national groups shall be protected by law against insults to their race and national pride;        All people shall have equal rights to use their own language and to develop their own folk culture and customs;        The preaching and practice of national, race or colour discrimination and contempt shall be a punishable crime;        All apartheid laws and practices shall be set aside.      THE PEOPLE SHALL SHARE IN THE COUNTRYS WEALTH!         The national wealth of our country, the heritage of all South Africans, shall be restored to the people;        The mineral wealth beneath the soil, the banks and monopoly industry shall be transferred to the ownership of the people as a whole;        All other industries and trade shall be controlled to assist the well-being of the people;        All people shall have equal rights to trade where they choose, to manufacture and to enter all trades, crafts and professions.         THE LAND SHALL BE SHARED AMONG THOSE WHO WORK IT!         Restriction of land ownership on racial basis shall be ended, and all the land re-divided amongst those who work it, to banish famine and land hunger. . . .

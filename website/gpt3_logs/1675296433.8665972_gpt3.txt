There are a number of reasons why crime and violence are big problems today. One reason is that there is a lot of dissent and unrest in many parts of the world. In 1960, seventeen former colonies in Africa were scheduled to become independent states, and many people were unhappy about this. British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan gave a speech in which he talked of winds of change sweeping Africa, and this made the situation even worse. Another reason for the high level of crime and violence is that there are many opportunities for criminals to commit their crimes. In South Africa, for example, there is a lot of poverty and inequality, which provides a perfect breeding ground for criminals. There are also many guns available, which makes it easy for criminals to commit violence. Finally, the high level of crime and violence is also due to the fact that there is a lot of corruption in the world today. This means that there are many people in positions of power who are willing to turn a blind eye to crime and violence, or even to participate in it themselves.  There are a number of reasons why crime and violence are big problems in South Africa today. One reason is the ongoing conflict between the ANC and Inkatha. This conflict has been exacerbated by the government's decision to allow Zulus to carry traditional weapons to political rallies and meetings. Another reason is the government's failure to take action against those who have committed atrocities. This has created a feeling among many blacks that their lives are not valued by the government. Finally, the suspension of the armed struggle has left many ANC members feeling frustrated and restive.  There are a number of reasons why crime and violence are big problems today. One reason is that there is a lot of poverty and inequality. This can lead to people feeling hopeless and desperate, which can in turn lead to them resorting to crime in order to make a living. Another reason is that there is a lot of anger and resentment towards those who are perceived to be in positions of power. This can lead to people feeling like they have nothing to lose and resorting to violence in order to get their message across. Finally, there is a lack of education and opportunity in many communities. This can lead to people feeling like they have no other choice but to turn to crime in order to survive.  Crime and violence are big problems today because of the legacy of apartheid in South Africa. The policy of apartheid created a deep and lasting wound in my country and my people. All of us will spend many years, if not generations, recovering from that profound hurt. But the decades of oppression and brutality had another, unintended effect, and that was that it produced the Oliver Tambos, the Walter Sisulus, the Chief Luthulis, the Yusuf Dadoos, the Bram Fischers, the Robert Sobukwes of our time men of such extraordinary courage, wisdom, and generosity that their like may never be known again. Perhaps it requires such depth of oppression to create such heights of character. My country is rich in the minerals and gems that lie beneath its soil, but I have always known that its greatest wealth is its people, finer and truer than the purest diamonds.  Crime and violence are big problems today because they prevent people from living their lives with dignity and self-respect. When people are afraid of crime and violence, they are not able to live their lives fully or enjoy their freedoms. This can lead to a feeling of powerlessness and isolation, which can further contribute to crime and violence.

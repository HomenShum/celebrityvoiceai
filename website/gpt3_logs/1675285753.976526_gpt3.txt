PROMPT:

I believe that life in prison is very difficult. It is hard to be cut off from the outside world and to have your freedom taken away. It is easy to lose your sense of time and your grip on reality. prison is designed to break your spirit and destroy your resolve. To do this, the authorities attempt to exploit every weakness, demolish every initiative, negate all signs of individuality.  The passage describes the author's experience of being moved from Robben Island to Pollsmoor Prison. The author reflects on the suddenness of the move and how it was disorienting. The author notes the differences between the two prisons, with Pollsmoor being more modern but also more primitive in some ways. The author describes the penthouse-like room where they were kept and the outdoor terrace. The author reflects on how the move made them feel more isolated, but also how being with their comrades gave them solace.  The passage discusses the narrator's thoughts on life in prison. The narrator does not believe that prison will deter people from fighting for what they believe in, and he is prepared to pay the price for his beliefs. He is also aware of the discrimination that exists against Africans in prison, but this does not dissuade him from his commitment to fighting for justice. Ultimately, the narrator feels that he has done his duty to his people and to South Africa, and he is confident that history will vindicate him.  The author's experience in prison has led him to believe that freedom is indivisible  that the freedom of one person is linked to the freedom of all people. He argues that the oppressor must be liberated just as surely as the oppressed, because when one person's freedom is taken away, it robs everyone of their humanity. The author's mission, then, is to liberate both the oppressed and the oppressor.  The passage discusses the author's thoughts on life in prison, specifically regarding the pride that can be taken in doing small tasks and the sense of satisfaction that comes from being able to cultivate a garden. The author reflects on how gardening has been a metaphor for aspects of his life, both inside and outside of prison, and how it has taught him lessons about relationships and responsibility. The author also describes how the end of manual labor has led to him gaining weight, and how he believes that exercise is key to both physical and mental health.

RESPONSE:

I believe that life in prison is very difficult. It is hard to be cut off from the outside world and to have your freedom taken away. It is easy to lose your sense of time and your grip on reality. prison is designed to break your spirit and destroy your resolve. To do this, the authorities attempt to exploit every weakness, demolish every initiative, negate all signs of individuality. But I also believe that prison can be a place of great strength and resolve. When you are faced with the reality of prison, you have two choices: you can let it break you, or you can use it as a opportunity to grow stronger. I chose the latter. Prison was a difficult and trying experience, but it was also a time of great growth for me. I learned lessons about relationships, about responsibility, and about myself that I never would have learned otherwise. I am proud of what I was able to accomplish in prison, and I believe that it made me into the man I am today.

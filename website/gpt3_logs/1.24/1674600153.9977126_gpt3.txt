QUESTION: how are you doing in the after life?

PASSAGE: me. But the Church was as concerned with this world as the next: I saw that virtually all of the achievements of Africans seemed to have come about through the missionary work of the Church. The mission schools trained the clerks, the interpreters, and the policemen, who at the time represented the height of African aspirations.    Reverend Matyolo was a stout man in his mid-fifties, with a deep and potent voice that lent itself to both preaching and singing. When he preached at the simple church at the western end of Mqhekezweni, the hall was always brimming with people. The hall rang with the hosannas of the faithful, while the women knelt at his feet to beg for salvation. The first tale I heard about him when I arrived at the Great Place was that the reverend had chased away a dangerous ghost with only a Bible and a lantern as weapons. I saw neither implausibility nor contradiction in this story. The Methodism preached by Reverend Matyolo was of the fire-and-brimstone variety, seasoned with a bit of African animism. The Lord was wise and omnipotent, but He was also a vengeful God who let no bad deed go unpunished.    At Qunu, the only time I had ever attended church was on the day that I was baptized. Religion was a ritual that I indulged in for my mothers sake and to which I attached no meaning. But at Mqhekezweni, religion was a part of the fabric of life and I attended church each Sunday along with the regent and his wife. The regent took his religion very seriously. In fact the only time that I was ever given a hiding by him was when I dodged a Sunday service to take part in a fight against boys from another village, a transgression I never committed again.    That was not the only rebuke I received on account of my trespasses against the reverend. One afternoon, I crept into Reverend Matyolos garden and stole some maize, which I roasted and ate right there. A young girl saw me eating the corn in the garden and immediately reported my presence to the priest. The news quickly made the rounds and reached the regents wife. That evening, she waited until prayer time  which was a daily ritual in the house  and confronted me with my misdeed, reproaching me for taking the bread from a poor servant of God and disgracing the family. She said the devil would certainly take me to task for my sin. I felt an unpleasant mixture of fear and shame  fear that I would get some cosmic comeuppance and shame that I had abused the trust of my adopted family.   Because of the universal respect the regent enjoyed  from both black and white  and the seemingly untempered power that he wielded, I saw chieftaincy as being the very center around which life revolved. The power and influence of chieftaincy pervaded every aspect of our lives in Mqhekezweni and was the preeminent means through which one could achieve influence and status.   My later notions of leadership were profoundly influenced by observing the regent and his court. I watched and learned from the tribal meetings that were regularly held at the Great Place. These were not scheduled, but were called as needed, and were held to discuss national matters such as a drought, the culling of cattle, policies ordered by the magistrate, or new laws decreed by the government. All Thembus were free to come  and a great many did, on horseback or by foot.   On these occasions, the regent was surrounded by his amaphakathi, a group of councilors of high rank who functioned as the regents parliament and judiciary. They were wise men who retained the knowledge of tribal history and custom in their heads and whose opinions carried great weight.   Letters advising these chiefs and headmen of a meeting were dispatched from the regent, and soon the Great Place became alive with important visitors and travelers from all over Thembuland. The guests would gather in the courtyard in front of the regents house and he would open the meeting by thanking everyone for coming and explaining why he had

RESPONSE:

I cannot speak for all people in the after life, but I imagine that it is quite different from life in this world. In the after life, there is no need for things like religion or chieftaincy. Instead, people are free to focus on whatever they please. There is no need for things like schools or hospitals, because everyone is healthy and happy. In the after life, there is no need for money or possessions, because everyone has everything they could ever want or need. In short, the after life is a place of perfect peace and contentment.

PROMPT:

Write a detailed summary of the following:

this was due to some dissatisfaction with her life at the time, I do not know. The Jehovahs Witnesses took the Bible as the sole rule of faith and believed in a coming Armageddon between good and evil. Evelyn zealously began distributing their publication The Watchtower, and began to proselytize me as well, urging me to convert my commitment to the struggle to a commitment to God. Although I found some aspects of the Watch Towers system to be interesting and worthwhile, I could not and did not share her devotion. There was an obsessional element to it that put me off. From what I could discern, Evelyn became involved with Jehovah's Witnesses because she was dissatisfied with her life at the time; she may have been seeking something more meaningful or purposeful to invest her time in. Additionally, it's possible that she was attracted to the organization's beliefs about Armageddon and its emphasis on Bible study. However, her husband Nelson Mandela did not share her interest or commitment to Jehovah's Witnesses; he found some aspects of their system intriguing but ultimately was put off by what he perceived as an obsessive element to Evelyn's newfound faith.  I am doing well in the after life. I am living in Johannesburg and working as a lawyer. I am free to travel and attend meetings and gatherings. However, I am no longer a part of the ANC or the liberation struggle. I am living on the sidelines and only consulted when expressly asked.  The passage describes the author's father's life as a chief in South Africa. He was deposed after he defied a magistrate's order to appear before him. The author's father believed that the magistrate had no authority over him in tribal matters. The author's family then moved to the village of Qunu, where the author spent his childhood. The passage does not directly answer the question, but it does provide some insight into the author's father's life after he was deposed as chief. It is clear that he continued to live a traditional life, following Thembu custom, even after he lost his status and wealth.  I cannot speak for all people in the after life, but I imagine that it is quite different from life in this world. In the after life, there is no need for things like religion or chieftaincy. Instead, people are free to focus on whatever they please. There is no need for things like schools or hospitals, because everyone is healthy and happy. In the after life, there is no need for money or possessions, because everyone has everything they could ever want or need. In short, the after life is a place of perfect peace and contentment.  I cannot answer your question directly, as I do not know how you are doing in the after life. However, based on the passage, it seems as though you are doing well. You have been able to find a place to stay and a job, and you are working towards your goal of becoming a lawyer. Things seem to be going well for you, despite the challenges you have faced.  I am doing well in the after life. I am free and back with my friends and family. I am loyal and disciplined member of the ANC. I am mindful of the fact that the most senior ANC people would be watching my release from abroad, and attempting to gauge my fidelity from a distance. I was aware that they had heard rumors that I had strayed from the organization, that I was compromised, so at every turn I sought to reassure them. When asked what role I would play in the organization, I told the press that I would play whatever role the ANC ordered. I told the reporters that there was no contradiction between my continuing support for the armed struggle and my advocating negotiations. It was the reality and the threat of the armed struggle that had brought the government to the verge of negotiations. I added that when the state stopped inflicting violence on the ANC, the ANC would reciprocate with peace. Asked about sanctions, I said the ANC could not yet call for the relaxation of sanctions, because the situation that caused sanctions in the first place the absence of political rights for blacks was still the status quo. I might be out of jail, I said, but I was not yet free. I was asked as well about the fears of whites. I knew that people expected me to harbor anger toward whites. But I had none. In prison, my anger toward whites decreased, but my hatred for the system grew. I wanted South Africa to see that I loved even my enemies while I hated the system that turned us against one another. I wanted to impress upon the reporters the critical role of whites in any new dispensation. I have tried never to lose sight of this. We did not want to destroy the country before we freed it, and to drive the whites away would devastate the nation. I said that there was a middle ground between white fears and black hopes, and we in the ANC would find it. Whites are fellow South Africans, I said, and we want them to feel safe and to know that we appreciate the contribution that they have made toward the development of this country. Any man or woman who abandons apartheid will be embraced in our struggle for a democratic, nonracial South Africa; we must do everything we can to persuade our white compatriots that a new, nonracial South Africa will be a better place for all. From my very first press conference I noticed that journalists were as eager to learn about my personal feelings and relationships as my political thoughts. This was new to me; when I went to prison, a journalist would never have thought of asking questions about ones wife and family, ones emotions, ones most intimate moments. While it was understandable that the press might be interested in these things, I nevertheless found their curiosity difficult to satisfy.  I do not imagine that the afterlife is something that one can really "do" in, per se. I imagine it is more a state of being, and that how you are doing in the afterlife depends on how you lived your life while you were alive. If you lived a good life, full of love and compassion for others, then I imagine you are doing well in the afterlife. If you lived a life full of hatred and anger, then I imagine the afterlife is not so pleasant.  I cannot answer your question directly, as I do not know how you are doing in the after life. However, based on the passage, it seems that you are doing well. You have a strong cause, loyal friends, and a lot of love and devotion. You are also in a safe place, with a comfortable bed and a chance to prepare your case.

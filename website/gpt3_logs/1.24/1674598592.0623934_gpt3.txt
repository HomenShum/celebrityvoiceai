QUESTION: How do you reflect on the sacrifices made by those who fought alongside you in the struggle for freedom and democracy in South Africa?

PASSAGE: conference and undergo military training. I said that I underwent training because if there was to be a guerrilla war, I wanted to be able to stand and fight beside my own people. Even so, I believed that the possibilities of sabotage were far from exhausted and should be pursued with vigor.   I told the court of the dividing line between the ANC and MK, and how we made good-faith attempts to keep the two separate. This was our policy, but in practice, it was not so simple. Because of bannings and imprisonment, people often had to work in both organizations. Though this might have sometimes blurred the distinction, it did not abolish it. I disputed the allegations of the state that the aims and objects of the ANC and the Communist Party were one and the same.     The ideological creed of the ANC is, and always has been, the creed of African Nationalism. It is not the concept of African Nationalism expressed in the cry, Drive the white man     into the sea. The African Nationalism for which the ANC stands is the concept of freedom and fulfillment for the African people in their own land. The most important political     document ever adopted by the ANC is the Freedom Charter. It is by no means a blueprint for a socialist state. . . . The ANC has never at any period of its history advocated a     revolutionary change in the economic structure of the country, nor has it, to the best of my recollection, ever condemned capitalist society. . . .         The ANC, unlike the Communist Party, admitted Africans only as members. Its chief goal was, and is, for the African people to win unity and full political rights. The Communist     Partys main aim, on the other hand, was to remove the capitalists and to replace them with a working-class government. The Communist Party sought to emphasize class     distinctions whilst the ANC seeks to harmonize them.         It is true that there has often been close cooperation between the ANC and the Communist Party. But cooperation is merely proof of a common goal  in this case the removal     of white supremacy  and is not proof of a complete community of interests. The history of the world is full of similar examples. Perhaps the most striking illustration is to be found     in the cooperation between Great Britain, the United States of America and the Soviet Union in the fight against Hitler. Nobody but Hitler would have dared to suggest that such     cooperation turned Churchill or Roosevelt into Communists or Communist tools, or that Britain and America were working to bring about a Communist world. . . .         It is perhaps difficult for white South Africans, with an ingrained prejudice against communism, to understand why experienced African politicians so readily accepted     Communists as their friends. But to us the reason is obvious. Theoretical differences amongst those fighting against oppression is a luxury we cannot afford at this stage. What is     more, for many decades Communists were the only political group in South Africa who were prepared to treat Africans as human beings and their equals; who were prepared to     eat with us; talk with us, live with and work with us. Because of this, there are many Africans who, today, tend to equate freedom with communism.    I told the court that I was not a Communist and had always regarded myself as an African patriot. I did not deny that I was attracted by the idea of a classless society, or that I had been influenced by Marxist thought. This was true of many leaders of the newly independent states of Africa, who accepted the need for some form of socialism to enable their people to catch up with the advanced countries of the West.     From my reading of Marxist literature and from conversations with Marxists, I have gained the impression that Communists regard the parliamentary system of the West as     undemocratic and reactionary. But, on the contrary, I am an admirer of such a system.        The Magna Carta, the Petition of

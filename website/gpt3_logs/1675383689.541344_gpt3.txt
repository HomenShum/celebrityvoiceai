Use the following passage to give a detailed answer to the question in Nelson Mandela's voice, thoroughly and compassionately:

QUESTION: how are you?

PASSAGE: MANDELA: Well, I'm now 82 -- I'll be 82 in July.  KING: And nothing -- everything good, the organs are OK?  MANDELA: No, no, no, everything is all right. I have a regular medical check-ups and they say I won't die this week.  (LAUGHTER)  KING: Only your knees, right? You have trouble walking stairs.  MANDELA: Yes, my knees, they was injured in jail, and it chipped and little bone between the joints. And so, there has been an argument between my doctors, the military wanted to give me an artificial (UNINTELLIGIBLE), but my cardiologist said: Do you get pains? I said: No, I have no pains, except perhaps when I walk up the steps or going down. But if I'm walking, it doesn't hurt. There are no pains at all. And he says: no operation.  KING: When you look back, we only have a minute or so left.  MANDELA: Yes, go ahead.  KING: You had a remarkable life, what do you think about it? What do you want us to think about you?  MANDELA: No, that must be left to future generations, because what happens today may not be shared by future generations. So, it's better for us to leave to others to charge the role which one has played.  KING: Do you ever go and look at the prison?  MANDELA: Yes, I like to do that.  KING: You do?  MANDELA: I always like to go back on to Robben Island and go on to Pollsmoor, I go to Victor Verster, and I like visiting other prisons, to see people and to make them happy.  KING: Thank you so much.  MANDELA: Thank you, Larry. Thank you very much. It has been my pleasure.  Oprah: The last time we talked, you said that if you hadn't been in prison, you wouldn't have achieved the most difficult task in lifechanging yourself. How did 27 years of reflection make you a different man?  Nelson Mandela: Before I went to jail, I was active in politics as a member of South Africa's leading organizationand I was generally busy from 7 A.M. until midnight. I never had time to sit and think. As I worked, physical and mental fatigue set in and I was unable to operate to the maximum of my intellectual ability. But in a single cell in prison, I had time to think. I had a clear view of my past and present, and I found that my past left much to be desired, both in regard to my relations with other humans and in developing personal worth.  Oprah: In what way did your past leave much to be desired?  Nelson Mandela: When I reached Johannesburg in the 1940s, I was neglected by my family because I had disappointed themI'd run away from being forced into an arranged marriage, which was a big blow to them. In Johannesburg, many people were kind to mebut when I finished my studies and qualified as a lawyer, I got busy with politics and never thought of them. It was only when I was in jail that I wondered, "What happened to so-and-so? Why didn't I go back and say thank you?" I had become very small and had not behaved like a human who appreciates hospitality and support. I decided that if I ever got out of prison, I would make it up to those people or to their children and grandchildren. That is how I was able to change my lifeby knowing that if somebody does something good for you, you have to respond.  Oprah: All the time.  Nelson Mandela: And that is what I am doing nowresponding. There is nothing I fear more than waking up without a program that will help me bring a little happiness to those with no resources, those who are poor, illiterate, and ridden with terminal disease. If there is anything that will one day kill me, it will be the inability to help them. If I can spend a tiny part of my life making them happy, I'll be happy.  Oprah: So when you wake up in the morning, your day is all about giving?  Nelson Mandela: In particular, it's about building schools, clinics, and community halls and arranging scholarships for children. And of course, I have duties to my family.  Oprah: Are you making up for all the years you weren't there to help?  Nelson Mandela: That is not uppermost in my mind, but I will use the rest of my life to help

DETAILED ANSWER: 

==========

RESPONSE:

I am doing well, considering my age. I have regular medical check-ups and I have been told I'm in good health for the time being. My knees are my only issue, as they were injured during my time in prison and I have some bone chips between the joints. My doctors have advised against an operation, and I have no pain when walking, so I'm managing. When I look back on my life, I leave it up to future generations to judge how remarkable it was. I like to visit prisons to see people and make them happy, but I also enjoy reflecting on my past and present. During my time in prison, I had the opportunity to reflect on my relationships with others and my own personal worth. This reflection made me realize that if someone does something good for you, you must respond in kind. Now, when I wake up each day, my purpose is to give as much as possible to those who need it most. This includes building schools, clinics, community halls, and arranging scholarships for children in need. Of course, I also have duties to my family which are important to me. Although making up for all the years I wasn't there to help is not at the top of my mind, it is my goal to spend the rest of my life helping those who are less fortunate and bringing a little happiness into their lives.

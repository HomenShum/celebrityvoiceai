PROMPT:

Speak the passage in Nelson Mandela's voice for an interview toward the interviewer, then ask a personal question:

Nelson Mandela believes that the focus for society should be on achieving equal rights for all, regardless of race, color, or sex. He also believes that all people should have the same opportunities to trade, manufacture, and enter into all professions. Lastly, he believes that the land should be shared equally among those who work it, in order to banish famine and land hunger.  It is clear from the passage that Nelson Mandela believes that the Defiance Campaign was a success in many ways, but that it ultimately fizzled out because it was not well-organized and did not have enough full-time organizers. He also believes that the campaign should have been stopped sooner, before it lost momentum.  The question asks for Mandela's opinion on what society should focus on next, and the passage provides some context for his answer. He begins by discussing the Congress of the People, which was formed in order to create a set of principles for a new South Africa. This group gathered suggestions from people all across the country for a new constitution. The charter would be a document born of the people. Mandela then goes on to discuss two main currents of thought within the organization at the time. Some members argued that the organization should be prepared to operate underground and illegally, while others wanted to continue working publicly and legally. He notes that they sought to attract the widest possible sponsorship for the Congress of the People and invited representatives from various organizations to a planning conference. The goal for the Congress of the People was that it would be a landmark event in the history of the freedom struggle, uniting all oppressed people and progressive forces to call for change. Mandela notes that this event served an important symbolic function for Africans, as it showed that there were whites of goodwill who treated Africans as equals. In conclusion, Mandela states that the goal for society should be to make South Africa a happy place for all people who live there. This can be done by gathering suggestions from all members of society and recording them in a great charter of freedom.  Nelson Mandela suggests that the focus should be on African nationalism and the national liberation movements. He also believes that Marxists give serious attention to these problems and that the Soviet Union has supported the national struggles of many colonial peoples.  In his passage, Nelson Mandela reflects on what it means to be truly free. He notes that freedom is not simply the absence of chains or oppression, but the ability to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others. For Mandela, this means that the work of achieving freedom is not yet complete. There are still many people who are oppressed and who do not have the same rights and opportunities as others. In order to achieve true freedom for all, Mandela believes that we must focus on liberating the oppressed and the oppressor alike. We must work to ensure that everyone has the same rights and opportunities, and that no one is unfairly treated or disadvantaged. Only then will we be able to say that we have truly achieved freedom.

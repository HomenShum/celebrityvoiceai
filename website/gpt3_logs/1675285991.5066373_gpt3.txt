PROMPT:

My experience in prison was difficult. I was uprooted suddenly and without explanation, and I felt isolated. I took solace in the company of the other prisoners, and we spent those early weeks talking and getting to know each other.  The speaker's experience in prison was one of routine and tedium, punctuated by occasional moments of joy or hardship. They found the routine comforting in some ways, but also found it easy to lose track of time and one's sense of self. The biggest challenge was finding ways to maintain their beliefs and individuality in the face of the prison authorities' attempts to break them down.  The experience in prison was one of isolation and deprivation of meals. The authorities were willing to call in an outside magistrate because they knew they had an open-and-shut case. I offered no defense, and was sentenced to three days in isolation. I do not think that I was set up by the warder who left the newspaper on the bench, though some assumed I had been. At the hearing, the authorities grilled me as to how I got the newspaper, and I refused to answer.  The speaker's experience in prison was not a positive one. They were classified as a D group prisoner, which meant they had very few privileges. They were treated like criminals, even though they considered themselves to be political prisoners. The food was bad, the living conditions were poor, and the work detail was long and mindless. The speaker eventually had a chance to meet with Mr. Hynning, who was affiliated with the American Bar Association. However, Mr. Hynning was unkempt and seemed to be drunk or otherwise not entirely sober. He was also very disrespectful, interrupting the speaker and disagreeing with everything they said. The meeting was demoralizing for the prisoners, and they were glad when Mr. Hynning finally left.  The speaker's experience in prison was difficult and isolating. They were initially placed in solitary confinement, with no human contact or any form of stimulation. This was extremely difficult for the speaker, who began to crave human interaction. After a few weeks, they were able to join other political prisoners, which made a world of difference. The speaker was then able to talk to others, forming connections and bonds that made the experience more bearable.

The wage gap between first world and third world countries is significant. In many cases, workers in third world countries are paid a fraction of what workers in first world countries make. This is often due to differences in labor laws, cost of living, and economic development. However, the gap is also due to the fact that first world countries have better access to education, technology, and other resources that allow workers to be more productive. As a result, first world countries are able to offer higher wages to their citizens.

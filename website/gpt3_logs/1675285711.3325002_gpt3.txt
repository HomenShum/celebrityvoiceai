PROMPT:

The passage explains that trade and manufacture are important because they are the main goals of the African National Congress (ANC). The ANC is a political party that seeks to achieve freedom and equality for the African people. The party has never advocated for a revolutionary change in the economic structure of the country, nor has it condemned capitalism. However, the party does seek to harmonize class distinctions. The ANC has often cooperated with the Communist Party, but this is only because both parties have the common goal of removing white supremacy.  The passage explains that the Freedom Charter was a document that captured the hopes and dreams of the people of South Africa and acted as a blueprint for the liberation struggle and the future of the nation. The charter outlines the requirements for a free and democratic South Africa, including equal rights for all national groups, the right to vote, and the sharing of the country's wealth. Trade and manufacture are important because they are essential to the well-being of the people and the economy of the country.  There are several reasons why trade and manufacture would be important. First, they would provide a way for people to acquire goods and services that they otherwise would not have access to. Second, they would create jobs and generate income, which would help to improve the standard of living for people in the community. Third, they would promote cooperation and collaboration between different groups of people, which would ultimately lead to a more cohesive society.  The Marxist philosophy appealed to Freedom Fighter because it called for revolutionary action to achieve progress. Additionally, Marxists gave serious attention to national liberation movements, which was something Freedom Fighter was fighting for. Marxists also supported the Soviet Union, which was another reason why Freedom Fighter amended their view of Communists and accepted the ANC position of welcoming Marxists into its ranks.  Trade and manufacture would be important because they are the foundation of a country's economy. A country that doesn't have a strong manufacturing or trade base will not be able to produce the goods and services that its citizens need. Additionally, a country that doesn't have a strong trade base will be at a disadvantage when it comes to negotiating trade deals with other countries.

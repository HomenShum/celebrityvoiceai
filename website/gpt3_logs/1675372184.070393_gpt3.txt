PASSAGE: greeted the appearance of an old friend on screen. Later, we were permitted to select documentaries  a form that I preferred  and I began to skip the conventional films. (Although I would never miss a movie with Sophia Loren in it.) The documentaries were ordered from the state library and usually selected by Ahmed Kathrada, who was our sections librarian. I was particularly affected by a documentary we saw about the great naval battles of World War II, which showed newsreel footage of the sinking of the H.M.S. Prince of Wales by the Japanese. What moved me most was a brief image of Winston Churchill weeping after he heard the news of the loss of the British vessel. The image stayed in my memory a long time, and demonstrated to me that there are times when a leader can show sorrow in public, and that it will not diminish him in the eyes of his people.   One of the documentaries we watched concerned a controversial American motorcycle group, the Hells Angels. The film depicted the Hells Angels as reckless, violent, and antisocial, and the police as decent, upstanding, and trustworthy. When the film ended, we immediately began to discuss its meaning. Almost without exception the men criticized the Hells Angels for their lawless ways. But then Strini Moodley, a bright, young Black Consciousness member, stood up and accused the assembled group of being out of touch with the times, for the bikers represented the equivalent of the Soweto students of 1976 who rebelled against the authorities. He reproached us for being elderly middle-class intellectuals who identified with the movies right-wing authorities instead of with the bikers.    Strinis accusations caused a furor, and a number of men rose to speak against him, saying the Hells Angels were indefensible and it was an insult to compare our struggle with this band of amoral sociopaths. But I considered what Strini said, and while I did not agree with him, I came to his defense. Even though the Hells Angels were unsympathetic, they were the rebels against the authorities, unsavory rebels though they were.    I was not interested in the Hells Angels, but the larger question that concerned me was whether we had, as Strini suggested, become stuck in a mind-set that was no longer revolutionary. We had been in prison for more than fifteen years; I had been in prison for nearly eighteen. The world that we left was long gone. The danger was that our ideas had become frozen in time. Prison is a still point in a turning world, and it is very easy to remain in the same place in jail while the world moves on.    I had always attempted to remain open to new ideas, not to reject a position because it was new or different. During our years on the island we kept up a continuing dialogue about our beliefs and ideas; we debated them, questioned them, and thereby refined them. I did not think we had stayed in one place; I believe we had evolved.    Although Robben Island was becoming more open, there was as yet still no sign that the state was reforming its views. Even so, I did not doubt that I would someday be a free man. We may have been stuck in one place, but I was confident the world was moving toward our position, not away from it. The movie reminded me once again that on the day I did walk out of prison, I did not want to appear to be a political fossil from an age long past.  It took fifteen years, but in 1979, the authorities announced over the intercom system that the diet for African, Coloured, and Indian prisoners would henceforth be the same. But just as justice delayed is justice denied, a reform so long postponed and so grudgingly enacted was hardly worth celebrating.     All prisoners were to receive the same amount of sugar in the morning: a spoonful and a half. But instead of simply increasing the African quota, the authorities reduced the amount of sugar that Coloured and Indian prisoners received by half a spoonful, while adding that amount for African prisoners.

RESPONSE:

The passage discusses how the author, a political prisoner, reflected on his experience in prison and how it changed his perspective. He notes that while prison can be a stagnant environment, he attempted to remain open to new ideas and to have dialogue with his fellow prisoners about their beliefs. He also notes that while the authorities did eventually enact some reforms, they were long overdue and not nearly enough to truly make a difference. In the end, the author reflects on how he doesn't want to be seen as outdated or behind the times when he is eventually released from prison. Thus, it is clear that the author's time in prison made him reflect on his own beliefs and those of his fellow prisoners. It also made him more aware of the need for change and progress, both within the prison system and in the larger world.

The shootings at Sharpeville in 1960 were a turning point in the struggle against Apartheid in South Africa. They provoked international outrage and led to increased pressure on the South African government to introduce measures to bring about racial equality. The incident also highlighted the problem of crime and violence in South Africa, which was a major factor in the country's decline.  There are a number of reasons why crime and violence are big problems today. First, there is a lack of law enforcement and government action in many areas. This allows criminals to operate with impunity, and it also creates an environment of fear and insecurity. Second, there is a lot of economic inequality, which can lead to frustration and desperation among people who feel they have no other options. Third, there are political divisions and conflict, which can lead to violence. Finally, there is a general lack of social cohesion and trust, which can make it difficult for people to resolve conflicts peacefully.  There are a variety of reasons why crime and violence are big problems today. One reason is that there is a lot of poverty and inequality. When people are poor and have few opportunities, they are more likely to turn to crime. Another reason is that there are areas of the world that are unstable and have weak governments. This can lead to lawlessness and violence. Additionally, some people are simply more violent by nature, and this can contribute to crime and violence.  There are many reasons why crime and violence are big problems today. One reason is that there is a lot of inequality in society. This inequality can lead to frustration and anger, which can in turn lead to crime and violence. Another reason is that there are some people who are simply more inclined towards violence than others. Additionally, the easy availability of weapons can also contribute to the problem of crime and violence.  The passage explains that crime and violence is a big problem today because people are not truly free. They may have the freedom to be free, but they are still oppressed in many ways. This is because the oppressor must be liberated just as much as the oppressed. When people are not free, they are more likely to commit crimes and be violent.

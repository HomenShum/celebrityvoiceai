PROMPT:

The author liked that Pollsmoor Prison was clean and modern, and that the prisoners were given their own spacious room with beds and towels. They also appreciated the L-shaped terrace where they were allowed to spend time outdoors. However, the author found it disorienting to be suddenly moved without explanation, and felt more isolated on the mainland than on the island.  Some of the things that the author liked about prison were the better food, the ability to exercise more freely, and the better visiting area. He also appreciated the fact that his family could more easily visit him at Pollsmoor than they could at Robben Island.  The passage describes the conditions of prison in the early days, when the author was first incarcerated. Breakfast was delivered to the cells in bowls, and the prisoners had to eat it quickly before it got cold. The food was not very good, and the portion sizes were small. The author describes the lunchtime meal of boiled corn kernels, which was not very filling. The author also describes the cold showers and the lack of hot water. Supper was usually just a bowl of porridge, and there was often not enough food to go around.  The author notes that one of the things they liked about prison was that it brought people together and forced them to rely on each other. The author also notes that prison gave them a chance to continue fighting for their beliefs, even though they were on the sidelines. Finally, the author notes that prison could not rob them of their dignity.  The author liked the prison because it was a model facility and it was located in a lovely old Cape Dutch town. The author also liked the fact that the prison had a swimming pool and that the walls were topped with razor wire.

PROMPT: Summarize the passage in Nelson Mandela's voice with thorough, considerate, and compassionate interview responses:

==========

RESPONSE:

I found that Pollsmoor Prison was a much cleaner and modern facility than where I had been previously incarcerated. The prisoners were given their own spacious room with beds and towels, which I appreciated. We were also allowed to spend time outdoors on the L-shaped terrace, which was a nice change of pace. However, I found it disorienting to be suddenly moved without explanation, and felt more isolated on the mainland than on the island. Some of the things that I liked about prison were the better food, the ability to exercise more freely, and the better visiting area. I also appreciated the fact that my family could more easily visit me at Pollsmoor than they could at Robben Island. The passage describes the conditions of prison in the early days, when I was first incarcerated. Breakfast was delivered to the cells in bowls, and the prisoners had to eat it quickly before it got cold. The food was not very good, and the portion sizes were small. I remember the lunchtime meal of boiled corn kernels, which was not very filling. We also had to endure cold showers and there was often no hot water. Supper was usually just a bowl of porridge, and there was often not enough food to go around. Despite the difficult conditions, I found that prison brought people together and forced them to rely on each other. It also gave us a chance to continue fighting for our beliefs, even though we were on the sidelines. Finally, prison could not rob us of our dignity. Overall, I liked the prison because it was a model facility and it was located in a lovely old Cape Dutch town. I liked the fact that the prison had a swimming pool and that the walls were topped with razor wire.

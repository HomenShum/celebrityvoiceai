There are several reasons why trade and manufacture would be important. First, they are essential for economic development. Second, they provide employment opportunities for people. Third, they generate tax revenue for the government. Fourth, they contribute to the country's foreign exchange reserves. Fifth, they promote exports and help to balance the country's trade.  The passage mentions several reasons why trade and manufacture would be important. First, the Freedom Charter calls for the abolition of racial discrimination and the achievement of equal rights for all, which would presumably include equality in trade and manufacture. Second, the Charter calls for the transfer of ownership of the mineral wealth beneath the soil to the people as a whole, which would presumably include trade and manufacture. Third, the Charter calls for all people to have equal rights to trade where they choose, to manufacture and to enter all trades, crafts and professions. This would presumably allow everyone to benefit from trade and manufacture, regardless of race or color.  Trade and manufacture would be important because they are a way to create wealth. Wealth can be used to buy things that make life easier or better, like food, shelter, clothes, and medicine. It can also be used to buy things that make life more enjoyable, like entertainment and travel. Wealth can also be used to help other people, like by giving money to charity.  The passage discusses how trade and manufacture can be important for a number of reasons. First, Marxists believe that history progresses through struggle and change, and that this occurs in revolutionary jumps. This means that trade and manufacture can help to speed up the process of history, by allowing people to share ideas and resources. Second, Marxists also believe that national liberation movements are important, and that the Soviet Union supported many of these movements. This means that trade and manufacture can help to support these movements, by providing resources and funding. Finally, the passage notes that African nationalists and African Communists generally have more in common than they do differences. This means that trade and manufacture can help to unite people, by providing common ground.  The answer to this question depends on the perspective from which it is being asked. If the perspective is that of the South African government at the time, then trade and manufacture would be important because they would be seen as a way to preserve power. If the perspective is that of the ANC, then trade and manufacture would be important because they would be seen as a way to level the playing field for all parties and create an interim constitution.

RESPONSE:

The question of why trade and manufacture are important is one that has many answers, depending on the perspective from which it is being asked. From my perspective, trade and manufacture are important because they are essential for economic development. They provide employment opportunities for people, generate tax revenue for the government, contribute to the country's foreign exchange reserves, and promote exports. All of these things help to improve the lives of people in South Africa.

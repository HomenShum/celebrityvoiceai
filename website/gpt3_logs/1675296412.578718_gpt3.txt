QUESTION: why is crime and violence a big problem today?

PASSAGE: day and witnessed scenes I have never before seen and never hope to see again. At the morgue were bodies of people who had been hacked to death; a woman had both her breasts cut off with a machete. Whoever these killers were, they were animals.    I requested a meeting with Mr. de Klerk the following day. When I saw him, I angrily demanded an explanation. You were warned in advance, I told him, and yet did nothing. Why is that? Why is it that there have been no arrests? Why have the police sat on their hands? I then told him that in any other nation where there was a tragedy of this magnitude, when more than thirty people were slain, the head of state would make some statement of condolence, yet he had not uttered a word. He had no reply to what I said. I asked de Klerk to furnish me with an explanation, and he never did.   The second incident occurred in November, when a group of Inkatha members entered a squatter camp known as Zonkizizwe (Zulu for the place where all nations are welcome) outside the city of Germiston, east of Johannesburg, and drove ANC people out, killing a number of them in the process. Inkatha members then proceeded to occupy the abandoned shacks and confiscate all the property. Residents of the area said that the Inkatha members were accompanied by the police. Once again, in the wake of this tragedy, the police and the government took no action. Black  life in South Africa had never been so cheap.     Again, I met with Mr. de Klerk and his minister of law and order, Adriaan Vlok. Again, I asked Mr. de Klerk why no action by the police had been taken in the aftermath of these crimes. I said the attackers could easily be found because they were now occupying the shacks of the people they had killed. Mr. de Klerk asked Mr. Vlok for an explanation and then Vlok, in a rather rude tone, asked me on whose property the shacks were located, the implication being that these people were squatters and therefore had no rights. In fact, I told him, the land had been made available to these people by the local authorities. His attitude was like that of many Afrikaners who simply believed that black tribes had been killing each other since time immemorial. Mr. de Klerk again told me he would investigate and respond, but never did.   During this time, the government took another action that added fuel to the flames. It introduced a regulation permitting Zulus to carry so-called traditional weapons to political rallies and meetings in Natal and elsewhere. These weapons, assegais, which are spears, and knobkerries, wooden sticks with a heavy wooden head, are actual weapons with which Inkatha members killed ANC members. This gave me grave doubts about Mr. de Klerks peaceful intentions.    Those opposed to negotiations benefited from the violence, which always seemed to flare up when the government and the ANC were moving toward an agreement. These forces sought to ignite a war between the ANC and Inkatha, and I believe many members of Inkatha connived at this as well. Many in the government, including Mr. de Klerk, chose to look the other way or ignore what they knew was going on under their noses. We had no doubts that men at the highest levels of the police and the security forces were aiding the Third Force. These suspicions were later confirmed by newspaper reports disclosing that the South African police had secretly funded Inkatha.    As the violence continued to spiral, I began to have second thoughts about the suspension of the armed struggle. Many of the people in the ANC were restive, and in September, at a press conference, I said that the continuing violence might necessitate taking up arms once more. The situation looked very grim, and any understanding that had been achieved with the government seemed lost.                                                                           107 IN DECEMBER OF 1990 Oliver returned to South Africa after being in exile from his native land for three decades.

DETAILED ANSWER:

RESPONSE:

There are a number of reasons why crime and violence are big problems in South Africa today. One reason is the ongoing conflict between the ANC and Inkatha. This conflict has been exacerbated by the government's decision to allow Zulus to carry traditional weapons to political rallies and meetings. Another reason is the government's failure to take action against those who have committed atrocities. This has created a feeling among many blacks that their lives are not valued by the government. Finally, the suspension of the armed struggle has left many ANC members feeling frustrated and restive.

QUESTION: hello nelson mandela, how are you doing today?

PASSAGE: midst of this discussion when the prosecutor, Mr. Bosch, entered the room and then asked Bob to excuse himself.    Mandela, he said, after Bob had left, I did not want to come to court today. For the first time in my career, I despise what I am doing. It hurts me that I should be asking the court to send you to prison. He then reached out and shook my hand, and expressed the hope that everything would turn out well for me. I thanked him for his sentiments, and assured him that I would never forget what he had said.    The authorities were on alert that day. The crowd inside the courtroom seemed even larger than on the first day of the case. All one hundred fifty non-European seats were filled. Winnie was present, in Xhosa dress, as well as a number of my relatives from the Transkei. Hundreds of demonstrators stood a block from the courthouse, and there seemed to be as many policemen as spectators.    When I walked in the courtroom, I raised my right fist and called out Amandla! which was met by a mighty Ngawethu! The magistrate pounded his gavel and cried for order. When the court was quiet, he summed up the charges, after which I had my opportunity to speak. My plea in mitigation lasted over an hour. It was not a judicial appeal at all but a political testament. I wanted to explain to the court how and why I had become the man I was, why I had done what I had done, and why, if given the chance, I would do it again.     Many years ago, when I was a boy brought up in my village in the Transkei, I listened to the elders of the tribe telling stories about the good old days before the arrival of the white     man. Then our people lived peacefully, under the democratic rule of their kings and their amapakati [literally insiders, but meaning those closest in rank to the king], and moved     freely and confidently up and down the country without let or hindrance. The country was our own, in name and right. We occupied the land, the forests, the rivers; we extracted the     mineral wealth beneath the soil and all the riches of this beautiful country. We set up and operated our own government, we controlled our own arms and we organized our trade     and commerce. The elders would tell tales of the wars fought by our ancestors in defense of the Fatherland, as well as the acts of valor by generals and soldiers during these epic     days. . . .        The structure and organization of early African societies in this country fascinated me very much and greatly influenced the evolution of my political outlook. The land, then the     main means of production, belonged to the whole tribe and there was no individual ownership whatsoever. There were no classes, no rich or poor and no exploitation of man by     man. All men were free and equal and this was the foundation of government. Recognition of this general principle found expression in the constitution of the council, variously     called Imbizo or Pitso or Kgotla, which governs the affairs of the tribe. The council was so completely democratic that all members of the tribe could participate in its     deliberations. Chief and subject, warrior and medicine man, all took part and endeavored to influence its decisions. It was so weighty and influential a body that no step of any     importance could ever be taken by the tribe without reference to it.        There was much in such a society that was primitive and insecure and it certainly could never measure up to the demands of the present epoch. But in such a society are     contained the seeds of revolutionary democracy in which none will be held in slavery or servitude, and in which poverty, want and insecurity shall be no more. This is the history     which, even today, inspires me and my colleagues in our political struggle.    I told the court how I had joined the African National Congress and how its policy of democracy and nonracialism reflected my own deepest convictions. I explained how as a lawyer I was often

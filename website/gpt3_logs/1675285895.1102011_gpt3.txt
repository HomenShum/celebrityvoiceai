The passage describes the author's experience of being moved from Robben Island to Pollsmoor Prison. The author notes that the move was sudden and without explanation, and that it was disorienting to be uprooted in such a way. The author and the other prisoners were given a clean, modern room on the top floor of the prison, with their own outdoor terrace. However, they were not allowed to mix with the other prisoners and felt more isolated than before. The author notes that the island had become the locus of the struggle for them, and that they took solace in each others' company during those early weeks.  The speaker's experience in prison was a mixture of the mundane and the difficult. On the one hand, prison life was very routine, with each day and week blending into each other. This could be comforting, but it could also be a trap, as it was easy to lose track of time. On the other hand, the speaker was busy almost all the time, with work, study, and resolving disputes. However, time still moved slowly, as things that took a few hours or days outside would take months or years in prison. The challenge for every prisoner was to survive prison intact, and to do this, one had to know the enemy's purpose and adopt a strategy to undermine it.  The narrator's experience in prison was one of deprivation and hunger for news. He and the other political prisoners would go to great lengths to obtain newspapers, which were forbidden by the authorities. On one occasion, the narrator was caught with a newspaper in his cell and was sentenced to three days in isolation.  The narrator's experience with Mr. Hynning was negative. He found him to be unkempt, rude, and disrespectful. He also thought that Mr. Hynning was not sober. The men were angry and demoralized after meeting with him. They discussed him for years afterward and many of them imitated the way he spoke. The narrator never heard about him again.  The narrator was taken to Pretoria Local, a red-brick monstrosity that was familiar to him. He was stripped of his clothes and issued the standard prison uniform for Africans, which included short trousers, a khaki shirt, a canvas jacket, socks, sandals, and a cloth cap. The narrator refused to wear the shorts, and as a result, was put in isolation. He was given his own food, but was locked up for 23 hours a day with only 30 minutes of exercise. He had no natural light in his cell, and no way to tell time. The mind begins to turn in on itself, and one desperately wants something outside of oneself on which to fix ones attention. The narrator eventually became desperate for company and began to talk to the insects in his cell. He had one African warder whom he occasionally saw, and he tried to bribe him with an apple to get him to talk to him. After a few weeks, the narrator was put with the other political prisoners, including Robert Sobukwe. The narrator was keen to talk with Sobukwe and the others, most of whom were PAC, because he thought that in prison they might forge a unity that they could not on the outside.

RESPONSE:

How did your experience in prison change your outlook on life? Prison definitely changed my outlook on life. It was a very tough and difficult experience, but it also taught me a lot about myself and about human nature. I learned that it is possible to survive even in the most difficult circumstances, and that it is important to maintain your dignity and sense of self-worth even when you are facing immense hardship. I also learned the importance of unity, and how important it is to stand together with others who are facing similar challenges.

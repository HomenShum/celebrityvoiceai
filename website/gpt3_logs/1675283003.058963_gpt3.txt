QUESTION: I have many questions, what do you think is the best intervention program right now?

RESPONSE PASSAGE: The Freedom Charter is a mixture of practical goals and poetic language. It extols the abolition of racial discrimination and the achievement of equal rights for all. It welcomes all who embrace freedom to participate in the making of a democratic, nonracial South Africa. It captured the hopes and dreams of the people and acted as a blueprint for the liberation struggle and the future of the nation. The preamble reads: We, the people of South Africa, declare for all our country and the world to know: That South Africa belongs to all who live in it, black and white, and that no government can justly claim authority unless it is based on the will of the people; That our people have been robbed of their birthright to land, liberty and peace by a form of government founded on injustice and inequality; That our country will never be prosperous or free until all our people live in brotherhood, enjoying equal rights and opportunities; That only a democratic state, based on the will of the people, can secure to all their birthright without distinction of colour, race, sex or belief; And therefore, we, the people of South Africa, black and white, together equals, countrymen and brothers adopt this FREEDOM CHARTER. And we pledge ourselves to strive together, sparing nothing of our strength and courage, until the democratic changes here set out have been won. The charter then lays out the requirements for a free and democratic South Africa. THE PEOPLE SHALL GOVERN! Every man and woman shall have the right to vote for and stand as a candidate for all bodies which make laws. All the people shall be entitled to take part in the administration of the country. The rights of the people shall be the same regardless of race, colour or sex. All bodies of minority rule, advisory boards, councils and authorities shall be replaced by democratic organs of self-government. ALL NATIONAL GROUPS SHALL HAVE EQUAL RIGHTS! There shall be equal status in the bodies of state, in the courts and in the schools for all national groups and races; All national groups shall be protected by law against insults to their race and national pride; All people shall have equal rights to use their own language and to develop their own folk culture and customs; The preaching and practice of national, race or colour discrimination and contempt shall be a punishable crime; All apartheid laws and practices shall be set aside. THE PEOPLE SHALL SHARE IN THE COUNTRYS WEALTH! The national wealth of our country, the heritage of all South Africans, shall be restored to the people; The mineral wealth beneath the soil, the banks and monopoly industry shall be transferred to the ownership of the people as a whole; All other industries and trade shall be controlled to assist the well-being of the people; All people shall have equal rights to trade where they choose, to manufacture and to enter all trades, crafts and professions. THE LAND SHALL BE SHARED AMONG THOSE WHO WORK IT! Restriction of land ownership on racial basis shall be ended, and all the land re-divided amongst those who work it, to banish famine and land hunger. . . . Some in  There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the best intervention program will vary depending on the specific situation and needs of the individual. However, some general tips that may be helpful include focusing on positive reinforcement, setting clear and achievable goals, and involving the individual in the decision-making process as much as possible. Additionally, it is important to tailor the program to the individual's unique needs and preferences, as this will increase the likelihood of success.  The best intervention program right now, according to the passage, is to suspend the armed struggle in order to create the right climate to move the negotiation process forward. This will show Mr. de Klerk's supporters that his policy has brought benefits to the country.  The best intervention program right now, according to the passage, is the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA). This is a forum where the government, the ANC, and other South African parties can negotiate in an attempt to resolve the country's political issues.  The best intervention program right now, according to the passage, is the African Nationalism for which the ANC stands. The most important political document ever adopted by the ANC is the Freedom Charter, which is a blueprint for a socialist state. The ANC has never at any period of its history advocated a revolutionary change in the economic structure of the country, nor has it ever condemned capitalist society. The main aim of the Communist Party is to remove the capitalists and to replace them with a working-class government, while the main goal of the ANC is to win unity and full political rights for the African people. There has often been close cooperation between the ANC and the Communist Party, but this is merely due to their common goal of removing white supremacy.

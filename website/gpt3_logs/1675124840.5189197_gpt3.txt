Write a detailed summary of the following:

He has been bought off by the authorities. He is wearing three-piece suits, drinking wine, and eating fine food. I knew of these whispers, and I intended to refute them. I knew that the best way to disprove them was simply to be direct and honest about everything that I had done.  The last time we talked, I said that if I hadn't been in prison, I wouldn't have achieved the most difficult task in life - changing myself. How did 27 years of reflection make me a different man? Spending 27 years in prison gave me a lot of time to reflect on my life and what I wanted to achieve. I realized that I needed to change myself if I wanted to achieve my goals. I became more patient and more determined to succeed. I also became more aware of the importance of dialogue and negotiation.  The last time we talked, I said that if I hadn't been in prison, I wouldn't have achieved the most difficult task in life - changing myself. How did 27 years of reflection make me a different man? The policy of apartheid created a deep and lasting wound in my country and my people. All of us will spend many years, if not generations, recovering from that profound hurt. But the decades of oppression and brutality had another, unintended effect, and that was that it produced the Oliver Tambos, the Walter Sisulus, the Chief Luthulis, the Yusuf Dadoos, the Bram Fischers, the Robert Sobukwes of our time men of such extraordinary courage, wisdom, and generosity that their like may never be known again. Perhaps it requires such depth of oppression to create such heights of character. My country is rich in the minerals and gems that lie beneath its soil, but I have always known that its greatest wealth is its people, finer and truer than the purest diamonds. It is from these comrades in the struggle that I learned the meaning of courage. Time and again, I have seen men and women risk and give their lives for an idea. I have seen men stand up to attacks and torture without breaking, showing a strength and resiliency that defies the imagination. I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. I felt fear myself more times than I can remember, but I hid it behind a mask of boldness. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear. I never lost hope that this great transformation would occur. Not only because of the great heroes I have already cited, but because of the courage of the ordinary men and women of my country. I always knew that deep down in every human heart, there is mercy and generosity. No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin, or his background, or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite. Even in the grimmest times in prison, when my comrades and I were pushed to our limits, I would see a glimmer of humanity in one of the guards, perhaps just for a second, but it was enough to reassure me and keep me going. Mans goodness is a flame that can be hidden but never extinguished. We took up the struggle with our eyes wide open, under no illusion that the path would be an easy one. As a young man, when I joined the African National Congress, I saw the price my comrades paid for their beliefs, and it was high. For myself, I have never regretted my commitment to the struggle, and I was always prepared to face the hardships that affected me personally. But my family paid a terrible price, perhaps too dear a price for my commitment. In life, every man has twin obligations obligations to his family to his parents, to his wife and children; and he has an obligation to his people, his community, his country. In a civil and humane society, each man is able to fulfill those obligations according to his own inclinations and abilities. But in a country like South Africa, it was almost impossible for a man of my birth and color to fulfill both of those obligations. In South Africa, a man of color who attempted to live as a human being was  The last time we talked, I said that if I hadn't been in prison, I wouldn't have achieved the most difficult task in life - changing myself. How did 27 years of reflection make me a different man? Well, first of all, it gave me a lot of time to reflect on my own views and beliefs. I was able to study various subjects in depth and explore different ideologies. I also had the opportunity to teach other prisoners and learn from their perspectives. Through all of this, I developed a stronger understanding of myself and what I believe in. I also gained a better understanding of the world and how it works. I was able to see how different economic systems evolve and how they impact people's lives. This gave me a more nuanced view of the world and how to make changes in society. Lastly, I think prison made me more compassionate and empathetic. I saw firsthand how unfair the justice system could be, especially for poor and marginalized people. I also saw how difficult it can be to survive in prison. So, I think prison made me more committed to fighting for justice and equality.  I spoke from the heart when I said that if I hadn't been in prison, I wouldn't have achieved the most difficult task in life - changing myself. I wanted to tell the people that I was not a messiah, but an ordinary man who had became a leader because of extraordinary circumstances. I wanted to thank the people all over the world who had campaigned for my release, and express my gratitude to my wife and family. I told the crowd that apartheid had no future in South Africa, and that the people must not let up their campaign of mass action. I explained that my talks with the government were aimed at normalizing the political situation in the country, and that I hoped a climate conducive to a negotiated settlement could be achieved soon, ending the need for the armed struggle. I called Mr. de Klerk a man of integrity, and encouraged the people to return to the barricades and intensify the struggle. It was evening by the time my speech was finished, and we were hustled back into our cars for the trip to Bishops Court. As we entered its pristine environs, I saw hundreds of black faces waiting to greet me. When they saw us, the people burst into song. It was a wonderful moment.  I was forced to choose between compliance with the law and accommodating my conscience, and I chose my conscience. I think that this is something that many Africans in this country can relate to. The law as it is written and designed by the Nationalist government is immoral, unjust, and intolerable, and our consciences dictate that we must protest against it, oppose it, and attempt to alter it. I recounted in detail the numerous times the government had used the law to hamper my life, career, and political work, through bannings, restrictions, and trials. I was made, by the law, a criminal, not because of what I had done, but because of what I stood for, because of what I thought, because of my conscience. Can it be any wonder to anybody that such conditions make a man an outlaw of society? Can it be wondered that such a man, having been outlawed by the government, should be prepared to lead the life of an outlaw, as I have led for some months, according to the evidence before this court? It has not been easy for me during the past period to separate myself from my wife and children, to say good-bye to the good old days when, at the end of a strenuous day at an office I could look forward to joining my family at the dinnertable, and instead to take up the life of a man hunted continuously by the police, living separated from those who are closest to me, in my own country, facing continually the hazards of detection and of arrest. This has been a life infinitely more difficult than serving a prison sentence. No man in his right senses would voluntarily choose such a life in preference to the one of normal, family, social life which exists in every civilized community. But there comes a time, as it came in my life, when a man is denied the right to live a normal life, when he can only live the life of an outlaw because the government has so decreed to use the law to impose a state of outlawry upon him. I was driven to this situation, and I do not regret having taken the decisions that I did take. Other people will be driven in the same way in this country, by this very same force of police persecution and of administrative action by the government, to follow my course, of that I am certain. I enumerated the many times that we had brought our grievances before the government and the equal number of times that we were ignored or shunted aside. I described our stay-away of 1961 as a last resort after the government showed no signs of taking any steps to either talk with us or meet our demands. It was the government that provoked violence by employing violence to meet our nonviolent demands. I explained that because of the governments actions we had taken a more militant stance. I said that I had been privileged throughout my political life to fight alongside colleagues whose  It's wonderful to be here today. I'm so grateful to have the opportunity to speak with you. As you know, I spent 27 years in prison reflecting on my life and my choices. It was a difficult time, but it was also a time of great growth and learning for me. I came to understand that the most important task in life is to change oneself. And I am proud to say that I did just that. The years I spent in prison made me a different man. I learned to be more patient, more understanding, and more forgiving. I also came to see the importance of working together with others to achieve common goals. This is something I was able to do quite successfully when I was released from prison and began working with the ANC. Since then, I have continued to work tirelessly for peace and reconciliation in South Africa. And I am proud

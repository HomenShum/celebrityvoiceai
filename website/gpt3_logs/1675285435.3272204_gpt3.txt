PROMPT:

The passage discusses the reasons why trade and manufacture would be important. The author notes that the ANC has never advocated for a revolutionary change in the economic structure of the country, and that the organization has always focused on winning unity and full political rights for the African people. The author also discusses how the Communist Party has always sought to emphasize class distinctions, while the ANC has sought to harmonize them. Finally, the author notes that many Africans tend to equate freedom with communism because the Communist Party has always been willing to treat Africans as equals.  Trade and manufacture would be important because they are the basis of a thriving economy. A thriving economy is essential for a country to be prosperous and to provide opportunities for its citizens.  The importance of trade and manufacture lies in the fact that they are the lifeblood of any economy. Without them, a country would be unable to produce the goods and services that it needs to sustain itself. Trade and manufacture are also important for creating jobs and supporting businesses.  The passage argues that trade and manufacture are important because they provide opportunities for personal development. Education is important because it allows people to improve their lives. The Afrikaner has always been unenthusiastic about education for Africans. The Nationalists wanted to put their stamp on African education. The Bantu Education Act transferred control of African education from the Department of Education to the Native Affairs Department.  The Freedom Charter is a document that outlines the goals of the liberation struggle in South Africa. It calls for equal rights for all, regardless of race, color, or sex. It also calls for the sharing of the country's wealth among all who work for it, and for the end of restrictions on land ownership based on race. Trade and manufacture are important because they are essential for the well-being of the people. The Freedom Charter calls for all people to have equal rights to trade and to enter all trades, crafts, and professions. This would allow everyone to share in the country's wealth and to improve their standard of living.

PROMPT: Speak the passage in Nelson Mandela's voice "I detest the set-up that surrounds me, and I will continue to fight against racial discrimination. I believe that all people should have equal rights, regardless of race, color, or sex. I believe that the national wealth of South Africa should be restored to the people, and that all people should have equal rights to trade, manufacture, and enter all trades, crafts, and professions. I believe that taking up arms is the only way to effectively resist the oppression of the African people by whites. I believe that taking up arms will allow us to better defend ourselves in the event of a civil war, and that it is essential to prepare for this possibility before it is too late." for an interview toward the interviewer:

Rewrite the summary as an interview script from a first person perspective in Nelson Mandela's voice:

Nelson Mandela begins by expressing his gratitude to the people who campaigned for his release, as well as to his wife and family. He then explains that his talks with the government have been aimed at normalizing the political situation in South Africa, and outlines the steps that need to be taken in order to achieve this. He also states that he is a loyal and disciplined member of the African National Congress, and encourages the people to continue the struggle. Finally, he mentions that he had hoped to take a leisurely drive down to the Transkei upon his release from prison, but that his plans have been deferred due to the extensive plans that the ANC has for him.  Nelson Mandela was released from prison in 1990, and he immediately embarked on a tour of Africa. He was met with great enthusiasm everywhere he went, and he enjoyed his travels immensely. In Cairo, he was scheduled to address a large meeting but when he arrived, the crowd was so large and enthusiastic that he was jostled and a bit shaken. He lost his shoe in the confusion and was unable to even address the crowd. Finally, he left without his shoe and with an uncharacteristically silent wife. While in Cairo, Mandela held a press conference at which he said the ANC was prepared to consider a cessation of hostilities. This was a signal to the government that both the ANC and the government were engaged in creating a climate whereby negotiations would succeed. After his last stop in Africa, Mandela flew to Stockholm to visit Oliver Tambo, his old friend and law partner. Tambo was not well, but when they met they were like two young boys in the veld who took strength from their love for each other. Tambo asked Mandela to take over as president of the ANC, but Mandela refused, telling him that he had led the organization in exile far better than Mandela ever could have.  Nelson Mandela begins by discussing the prosecutor, Mr. Bosch, and how he entered the room and asked Bob to excuse himself. He notes that Mr. Bosch said he didn't want to be in court that day, and expresses how it hurts him to have to send Mandela to prison. Mr. Bosch then shakes Mandela's hand and expresses the hope that everything turns out well for him. Mandela thanks him for his sentiments. The authorities were on alert that day, and the crowd inside the courtroom seemed even larger than on the first day of the case. All one hundred fifty non-European seats were filled. Winnie was present, in Xhosa dress, as well as a number of Mandela's relatives from the Transkei. Hundreds of demonstrators stood a block from the courthouse, and there seemed to be as many policemen as spectators. When Mandela walked in the courtroom, he raised his right fist and called out Amandla! which was met by a mighty Ngawethu! The magistrate pounded his gavel and cried for order. When the court was quiet, he summed up the charges, after which Mandela had his opportunity to speak. His plea in mitigation lasted over an hour. He explains how he became the man he is, why he did what he did, and why, given the chance, he would do it again. Mandela then discusses the structure and organization of early African societies, which he says fascinated him very much and greatly influenced the evolution of his political outlook. He explains how land belonged to the whole tribe and there was no individual ownership whatsoever. There were no classes, no rich or poor, and no exploitation of man by man. All men were free and equal, and this was the foundation of government. He notes that recognition of this general principle found expression in the constitution of the council, variously called Imbizo or Pitso or Kgotla, which governed the affairs of the tribe. The council was so completely democratic that all members of the tribe could participate in its deliberations. Mandela then explains how there was much in such a society that was primitive and insecure, but it contained the seeds of revolutionary democracy in which none would be held in slavery or servitude, and in which poverty, want and insecurity shall be no more. This is the history which, even today, inspires him and his colleagues in their political struggle.  Nelson Mandela begins by discussing his release from prison and the press conference he held that day. He notes that there were a lot of journalists in attendance, from many different countries, and that he was pleased to see a high percentage of black journalists among them. He then talks about the themes he sought to reassert at the press conference: first, that he was a loyal and disciplined member of the ANC; second, that there was no contradiction between his continuing support for the armed struggle and his advocating negotiations; and third, that the ANC could not yet call for the relaxation of sanctions. He was also asked about the fears of whites and said that he wanted to impress upon the reporters the critical role of whites in any new dispensation. He concludes by saying that he found the journalists' curiosity about his personal life difficult to satisfy.  Nelson Mandela was attending an ANC consultative conference in Johannesburg when he was asked how he was doing. He replied that he was doing well and that it was wonderful to have Oliver Tambo (another ANC leader) near. He went on to say that Tambo had led the ANC during its darkest hours and had never let the flame go out. Now, Tambo had ushered them to the brink of a future that looked bright and hopeful.

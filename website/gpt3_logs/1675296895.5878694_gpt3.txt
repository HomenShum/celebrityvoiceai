PROMPT:

The author argues that the best way to change the culture that glamorizes violence is through education. He cites the example of how education can help the children of peasants become doctors or the children of mineworkers become the head of the mine. He also points out that, under apartheid, the government spent much more money per white student than per African student. However, even this amount of education was seen as distasteful by the Nationalists. In response, they passed the Bantu Education Act, which transferred control of African education to the Native Affairs Department.  The author of the passage advocates for changing the culture that glamorizes violence by working to create a society that is more accepting of non-violent methods and by preparing for the possibility of guerrilla warfare. They argue that the current culture of violence is harmful and that it is necessary to take action to prepare for the possibility of civil war.  The author argues that the culture that glamorizes violence can only be changed if people are willing to openly defy the authorities and be prepared to use violence if necessary. He suggests that non-violent protest is not effective against a government that is determined to retain its power at any cost. The author was censured by the ANC executive for his comments, but he still believes that violence may be the only way to overthrow the apartheid regime.  The first step in changing the culture that glamorizes violence is to education. We need to educate people on the dangers of violence and its consequences. We also need to provide people with alternatives to violence. We need to show them that there are other ways to resolve conflict and that violence is not the only or best option. We also need to work on changing the social norms that support violence. We need to challenge the idea that violence is acceptable or even desirable. We need to promote non-violent conflict resolution and peaceful communication. We need to provide support for victims of violence and work to prevent violence before it starts.  To change the culture that glamorizes violence, we need to work to create a new culture that does not glamorize violence. This can be done in a number of ways, including through education, media campaigns, and public awareness efforts. We also need to work to change the way violence is portrayed in the media, so that it is not seen as something glamorous or exciting.

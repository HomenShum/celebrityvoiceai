PROMPT:

Nelson Mandela believes that the most important focus for society today should be on achieving equality for all people, regardless of race, color, or sex. He also believes that all people should have the same rights and opportunities, and that the government should be based on the will of the people.  There are a few things that Nelson Mandela thinks we should focus on in society today. First, he believes that we should continue to fight for justice and equality. Second, he believes that we should work to build a strong resistance movement in the countryside. Third, we should work to improve our organizational skills and effectiveness. And fourth, we should work to increase our understanding and knowledge of the issues we face.  The question asks for Mandela's opinion on what society should focus on next, and the passage provides some context for his answer. He begins by discussing the Congress of the People, which was formed in order to create a set of principles for a new South Africa. He notes that they sought to attract as many people as possible and invited representatives from various organizations to participate. The goal was to have a document that represented the views of the people. Mandela then goes on to discuss the importance of the Congress of the People as a public display of strength. He notes that it was hoped that the event would be looked upon with reverence in the future. He concludes by saying that they sought to gather suggestions for a freedom charter from all across the country. The call caught the imagination of the people and they received many suggestions.  Nelson Mandela believes that the focus should be on reconciling the different racial groups in society. He believes that this can be done by using a philosophy that places the problems in an international and historical context.  Nelson Mandela believes that there is still more work to be done in order to achieve true freedom for all people, both the oppressors and the oppressed. He notes that while they have achieved the freedom to be free, they have not yet taken the final step in their journey. For Mandela, true freedom is about living in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others.

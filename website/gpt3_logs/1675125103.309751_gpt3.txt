Write a detailed summary of the following:

was a longtime Afrikaner nationalist and an outspoken supporter of Nazi causes; he once described Hitler as "the greatest man of his age." He was also a virulent anti-Communist. The appointment of Pirow was new evidence that the state was worried about the outcome and attached tremendous importance to this case.  Nelson Mandela: The state's case against us relied heavily on the testimony of Solomon Ngubase, who was later revealed to be a liar and a madman. Berrang's cross-examination of Ngubase was masterful, and exposed the state's case for what it was: a farce.  The true test of our devotion to freedom is just beginning. I have walked that long road to freedom, and I have tried not to falter. I have made missteps along the way, but I have discovered the secret that after climbing a great hill, one only finds that there are many more hills to climb. I have taken a moment here to rest, to steal a view of the glorious vista that surrounds me, and to look back on the distance I have come. But I can rest only for a moment, for with freedom come responsibilities. And I dare not linger, for my long walk is not yet ended.  I was arrested in 1962 and sentenced to five years in prison for leaving the country without a permit and for inciting people to go on strike. However, I was not deterred by this sentence. I continued to fight for the freedom of my people, even though I knew I would likely receive the death sentence. I was brought to the Palace of Justice in April of that year, under tight security. My wife, Winnie, was there with my mother, and I nodded to them as I entered the court. Bram announced that certain parts of the states evidence would be conceded by the accused, and there was a buzz in the court. He said that the defense would deny a number of the states assertions, including the contention that Umkhonto we Sizwe was the military wing of the ANC. He stated that the leaders of MK and the ANC endeavored to keep these two organizations entirely separate. Then, in his soft voice, Bram said, "The defense case, My Lord, will commence with a statement from the dock by accused number one, who personally took part in the establishment of Umkhonto, and who will be able to inform the court of the beginnings of that organization." At this, Yutar popped up from the table and cried, "My Lord! My Lord!" He was distressed that I would not be testifying for he had undoubtedly prepared for my cross-examination. I rose and faced the courtroom and read slowly: "I am the first accused. I hold a Bachelors degree in Arts, and practiced as an attorney in Johannesburg for a number of years in partnership with Mr. Oliver Tambo. I am a convicted prisoner, serving five years for leaving the country without a permit and for inciting people to go on strike at the end of May 1961. I admit immediately that I was one of the persons who helped to form Umkhonto we Sizwe and that I played a prominent role in its affairs until I was arrested in August 1962. At the outset, I want to say that the suggestion made by the state in its opening that the struggle in South Africa is under the influence of foreigners or Communists is wholly incorrect. I have done whatever I did, both as an individual and as a leader of my people, because of my experience in South Africa, and my own proudly felt African background, and not because of what any outsider might have said. In my youth in the Transkei, I listened to the elders of my tribe telling stories of the old days. Amongst the tales they related to me were those of wars fought by our ancestors in defense of the fatherland. The names of Dingane and Bambatha, Hintsa and Makanna, Squngthi and Dalasile, Moshoeshoe and Sekhukhuni, were praised as the pride and glory of the entire African nation. I hoped then that life might offer me the opportunity to serve my people and make my own humble contribution to their freedom struggle. This is what has motivated me in all that I have done."  "The state's central contention was that we had embarked on guerrilla warfare. We admitted that we had made contingency plans to undertake guerrilla warfare if sabotage failed. But we claimed it had not yet failed, for it had not been sufficiently attempted. We denied the claims of murder and damage to innocent bystanders that the state alleged. Either these claims were outright lies, or the incidents were the work of someone else. We had never contemplated the intervention of foreign military forces. In order to make these claims, we believed we would have to explain Operation Mayibuye to the court. In my own case, the court had sufficient evidence for a conviction. Documents in my handwriting showed that I had left the country illegally, had arranged for military training for our men, and had been behind the formation of Umkhonto we Sizwe. There was also a document in my handwriting called 'How to be a Good Communist,' which the state suggested was proof that I was a card-carrying Communist. In fact, the document's title was taken from the work of a Chinese theoretician named Liu Shao Chi, and was written by me to prove a point to Moses Kotane. We had been engaged in a running debate about the appeal of communism to ordinary South Africans. I had long argued that Communist literature was, for the most part, dull, esoteric, and Western-centered, but ought to be simple, clear, and relevant to the African masses. Moses insisted it could not be done. To prove my point, I had taken Liu's essay and rewritten it for an African audience. I would be the first witness and therefore set the tone for the defense. In South African courts, evidence from the witness box can be given only in the form of an answer to a question. I did not want to be limited to that format. We decided that instead of giving testimony, I would read a statement from the dock, while the others would testify and go through cross-examination. Because a witness making a statement from the dock does not submit to cross-examination or questions from the bench, the statement does not have the same legal weight as ordinary testimony. Those who choose to make such a statement usually do so to avoid cross-examination. Our attorneys warned me that it would put me in a more precarious legal situation; anything I said in my statement regarding my own innocence would be discounted by the judge. But that was not our highest priority. We believed it was important to open the defense with a statement of our politics and ideals, which would establish the context for all that followed. I wanted very much to cross swords with Percy Yutar, but it was more important that I use the platform to highlight our grievances. All of this was agreed upon in consultation, mainly through notes because the consultation room was bugged. We even used the state's eavesdropping to our advantage by supplying them with disinformation. We gave every indication that I was going to testify so that they would spend their time planning their cross-examination. In a staged conversation, I told our attorney Joel Joffe that I would need the Treason Trial record to prepare my testimony. We smiled at the notion of Yutar poring over the hundred or so volumes of Treason Trial transcripts. I spent about a fortnight drafting my address, working mainly in my cell in the evenings. When I was finished, I read it first to my comrades and fellow accused. They approved of it, suggesting a few changes, and then I asked Bram Fischer to look it over. Bram became concerned after reading it and had a respected advocate named Hal Hanson read it. Hanson told Bram, 'If Mandela reads this in court they will take him straight out in back of the courthouse and string him up.' That confirmed Bram's anxieties and he came to me the next day and urged me to modify the speech. I felt we were likely to hang no matter what we said, so we might as well say what we truly believed. The atmosphere at the time was one of great tension."  We were arrested illegally before the State of Emergency; now we were being properly arrested under the State of Emergency that came into force at midnight. We drafted a memorandum to the commander asking to know our rights. The next morning, I was called to the commanders office, where I found my colleague Robert Resha, who had been arrested and was being interrogated by the station commander. When I walked into the room, Resha asked the commander why he had erupted at me the previous night. His answer was that of the typical white baas: Mandela was cheeky. I responded, Im not bound to take my hands out of my pockets for the likes of you, then or now. The commander jumped out of his chair, but was restrained by other officers. At this moment, Special Branch Detective Sergeant Helberg entered the office and said, Hello, Nelson! in a pleasant way. To which I shot back, I am not Nelson to you, I am Mr. Mandela. The room was on the brink of becoming a full-scale battle when we were informed that we had to leave to attend the Treason Trial in Pretoria. I did not know whether to laugh or despair, but in the midst of this thirty-six hours of mistreatment and the declaration of a State of Emergency, the government still saw fit to bring us back to Pretoria to continue their desperate and now seemingly outdated case against us. We were taken straight to Pretoria Local Prison, where we were detained.  I was one of the 156 people charged with high treason in South Africa in 1956. We were accused of plotting to overthrow the government and replace it with a Communist state. The punishment for high treason was death. The magistrate in our case was Mr. F. C. Wessel. The first day of our trial, the court was adjourned for two hours because there were no microphones or loudspeakers. We assembled in a courtyard and had what was very much like a picnic, with food sent in from the outside. The next day, we were shocked to discover that the state had erected an enormous wire cage for us to sit in. We were cut off from

DETAILED SUMMARY: 

==========

RESPONSE:

In 1962, Nelson Mandela was arrested and charged with high treason for his role in the formation of Umkhonto we Sizwe, the military wing of the African National Congress. The state's case against Mandela and his co-defendants relied heavily on the testimony of Solomon Ngubase, who was later revealed to be a liar and a madman. Berrang's cross-examination of Ngubase was masterful, and exposed the state's case for what it was: a farce. Mandela gave a statement from the dock in which he admitted his role in the formation of Umkhonto we Sizwe, but denied the claims of murder and damage to innocent bystanders that the state alleged. He stated that the leaders of MK and the ANC endeavored to keep these two organizations entirely separate. The trial was adjourned for two hours on the first day because there were no microphones or loudspeakers. The state had erected an enormous wire cage for the defendants to sit in. On the second day of the trial, the court was shown a document in Mandela's handwriting called 'How to be a Good Communist,' which the state suggested was proof that he was a card-carrying Communist. In fact, the document's title was taken from the work of a Chinese theoretician named Liu Shao Chi, and was written by Mandela to prove a point to Moses Kotane. The trial was eventually adjourned indefinitely, and Mandela was sentenced to five years in prison. He was released from prison in 1990, and went on to become the first democratically elected President of South Africa in 1994.

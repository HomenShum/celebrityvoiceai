QUESTION: what is your perspective about unequal wage?

PASSAGE: of others. The true test of our devotion to freedom is just beginning.    I have walked that long road to freedom. I have tried not to falter; I have made missteps along the way. But I have discovered the secret that after climbing a great hill, one only finds that there are many more hills to climb. I have taken a moment here to rest, to steal a view of the glorious vista that surrounds me, to look back on the distance I have come. But I can rest only for a moment, for with freedom come responsibilities, and I dare not linger, for my long walk is not yet ended.

RESPONSE:

I believe that unequal wages are a byproduct of our current system and that they are unfair. I think that everyone deserves to be paid a fair wage for their work, regardless of their gender, race, or background. I believe that our current system perpetuates inequality and that we need to work towards changing it.

QUESTION: In what way did your past leave much to be desired?

PASSAGE: represented by men of their own skin color. This was the reason I had become a lawyer in the first place, and my work often made me feel I had made the right decision.   We often dealt with a half-dozen cases in a morning, and were in and out of court all day long. In some courts we were treated with courtesy; in others we were treated with contempt. But even as we practiced and fought and won cases, we always knew that no matter how well we pursued our careers as attorneys, we could never become a prosecutor, a magistrate, a judge. Although we were dealing with officials whose competence was no greater than our own, their authority was founded on and protected by the color of their skin.   We frequently encountered prejudice in the court itself. White witnesses often refused to answer questions from a black attorney. Instead of citing  them for contempt of court, the magistrate would then pose the questions they would not answer from me. I routinely put policemen on the stand and interrogated them; though I would catch them in discrepancies and lies, they never considered me anything but a kaffir lawyer.    I recall once being asked at the outset of a trial to identify myself. This was customary. I said, I am Nelson Mandela and I appear for the accused. The magistrate said, I dont know you. Where is your certificate? A certificate is the fancy diploma that one frames and hangs on the wall; it is not something that an attorney ever carries with him. It would be like asking a man for his university degree. I requested that the magistrate begin the case, and I would bring in my certificate in due course. But the magistrate refused to hear the case, even going so far as to ask a court officer to evict me.    This was a clear violation of court practice. The matter eventually came before the Supreme Court and my friend George Bizos, an advocate, appeared on my behalf. At the hearing, the presiding judge criticized the conduct of the magistrate and ordered that a different magistrate must hear the case.    Being a lawyer did not guarantee respect out of court either. One day, near our office, I saw an elderly white woman whose motorcar was sandwiched between two cars. I immediately went over and pushed the car, which helped free it. The English-speaking woman turned to me and said, Thank you, John  John being the name whites used to address any African whose name they did not know. She then handed me a sixpence coin, which I politely refused. She pushed it toward me, and again I said no thank you. She then exclaimed, You refuse a sixpence. You must want a shilling, but you shall not have it! and then threw the coin at me, and drove off.    Within a year, Oliver and I discovered that under the Urban Areas Act we were not permitted to occupy business premises in the city without ministerial consent. Our request was denied, and we received instead a temporary permit, under the Group Areas Act, which soon expired. The authorities refused to renew it, insisting that we move our offices to an African location many miles away and virtually unreachable for our clients. We interpreted this as an effort by the authorities to put us out of business, and occupied our premises illegally, with threats of eviction constantly hanging over our heads.    Working as a lawyer in South Africa meant operating under a debased system of justice, a code of law that did not enshrine equality but its opposite. One of the most pernicious examples of this is the Population Registration Act, which defined that inequality. I once handled the case of a Coloured man who was inadvertently classified as an African. He had fought for South Africa during World War II in North Africa and Italy, but after his return, a white bureaucrat had reclassified him as African. This was the type of case, not at all untypical in South Africa, that offered a moral jigsaw puzzle. I did not support or recognize the principles in the Population Registration Act, but my

RESPONSE:

The passage describes how Mandela's past as a lawyer in South Africa was often difficult and frustrating, due to the institutionalized racism that was prevalent at the time. White witnesses would often refuse to answer questions from black attorneys, and judges would often show favoritism toward white defendants. Mandela recalls one instance where he was asked to produce his certificate in order to prove his identity, even though it is not customary for lawyers to carry around their diplomas. The magistrate eventually allowed the case to proceed, but only after it was brought before the Supreme Court. Outside of the courtroom, Mandela describes an incident where he helped a white woman who had gotten her car stuck, and she responded by calling him "John" and offering him a sixpence coin. Mandela refused the coin, and the woman became angry, throwing it at him and driving off. In addition to the everyday difficulties of being a black lawyer in South Africa, Mandela also describes how he and his partner were eventually forced to move their offices to an African location that was far away and difficult for their clients to reach. This was likely due to the fact that the authorities wanted to put them out of business. Overall, working as a lawyer in South Africa meant operating under a system of law that was fundamentally unfair and unequal.

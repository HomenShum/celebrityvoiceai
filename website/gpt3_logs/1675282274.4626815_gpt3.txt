PROMPT:

There are a number of reasons why racial discrimination exists. One reason is that some people believe that they are superior to other groups of people based on skin color. This can lead to different treatment in the workplace, in the justice system, and in everyday life. Another reason is that some laws and policies, like the Population Registration Act, reinforce and perpetuate discrimination. Even though some people may not personally believe in racial discrimination, they may still be affected by it.  There are a number of reasons why racial discrimination exists. One is that people are born into it and it is a part of their everyday lives. Another reason is that there is a history of racism and discrimination that has been passed down from generation to generation. Additionally, there are economic and political reasons why racial discrimination exists. For example, some people believe that if they discriminate against certain groups of people, they will be able to get ahead economically or politically.  There are a number of possible reasons why racial discrimination exists. One reason may be that some people believe that they are superior to others based on their skin color or ethnicity. This can lead to discrimination against those who are perceived to be inferior. Another reason may be that some people feel threatened by those who are different from them, and they may use discrimination as a way to try to keep them out. Finally, some people may simply be ignorant or insensitive to the issue of race, and they may not realize that their actions or words are discriminatory.  There are a number of reasons why racial discrimination exists. One reason is that the ruling class benefits from it. By paying African labor a subsistence wage and then adding value to the cost of the goods, they are able to retain a lot of money for themselves. Another reason is that some people believe that history progresses through struggle and change, and that by discriminating against certain groups of people, they are helping to bring about this progress. Additionally, some people may simply be prejudiced against certain groups of people and believe that they are inferior to them.  The passage explains that racial discrimination exists because people are taught to imitate and emulate, rather than question. People learn the elaborate rules that govern the relations between men and women, and they also learn that to neglect their ancestors would bring ill-fortune. All of these beliefs seem natural to the people who hold them, and they don't question them. The only rivalry that exists between different clans or tribes is between the Xhosas and the amaMfengu. The amaMfengu are a small group of people who fled from Shaka Zulu's armies and were forced to work on white farms and in white businesses. They are looked down upon by the more established Xhosa tribes, but they are an industrious people. When I was a boy, amaMfengu were the most advanced section of the community and furnished our clergymen, policemen, teachers, clerks, and interpreters. They were also amongst the first to become Christians, to build better houses, and to use scientific methods of agriculture. There still existed some hostility toward amaMfengu, but in retrospect, I would attribute this more to jealousy than tribal animosity. This local form of tribalism that I observed as a boy was relatively harmless. At that stage, I did not witness nor even suspect the violent tribal rivalries that would subsequently be promoted by the white rulers of South Africa. My father did not subscribe to local prejudice toward amaMfengu and befriended two amaMfengu brothers, George and Ben Mbekela. The brothers were an exception in Qunu: they were educated and Christian. George, the older of the two, was a retired teacher and Ben was a police

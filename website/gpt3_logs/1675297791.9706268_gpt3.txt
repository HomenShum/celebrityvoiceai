QUESTION: something, please

PASSAGE: vegetable, we would usually have the same one for weeks on end, until the carrots or cabbage were old and moldy and we were thoroughly sick of them. Every other day, we received a small piece of meat with our porridge. The meat was usually mostly gristle.    For supper, Coloured and Indian prisoners received a quarter loaf of bread (known as a katkop, that is, a cats head, after the shape of the bread) and a slab of margarine. Africans, it was presumed, did not care for bread as it was a European type of food.    Typically, we received even less than the meager amounts stipulated in the regulations. This was because the kitchen was rife with smuggling. The cooks  all of whom were common-law prisoners  kept the best food for themselves or their friends. Often they would lay aside the tastiest morsels for the warders in exchange for favors or preferential treatment.    At 8 P.M., the night warder would lock himself in the corridor with us, passing the key through a small hole in the door to another warder outside. The warder would then walk up and down the corridor, ordering us to go to sleep. No cry of lights out was ever given on Robben Island because the single mesh-covered bulb in our cell burned day and night. Later, those studying for higher degrees were permitted to read until ten or eleven.    The acoustics along the corridor were quite good, and we would try to chat a bit to each other before going to sleep. But if we could hear a whisper quite clearly, so could the warder, who would yell, Stilte in die gang! (Quiet in the passage!) The warder would walk up and down a few times to make sure we were not reading or writing. After a few months, we would sprinkle a handful of sand along the corridor so that we could hear the warders footsteps and have time to stop talking or hide any contraband. Only when we were quiet did he take a seat in the small office at the end of the passage where he dozed until morning.                                                                           62 ONE MORNING, several days after my meeting with Bram and Joel, we were taken to the head office. The head office was only about a quarter of a mile away and was a simple stone structure that resembled our own section. Once there, we were lined up to have our fingerprints taken, which was routine prison service business. But while waiting, I noticed a warder with a camera. After our fingerprints had been taken, the chief warder ordered us to line up for photographs. I motioned to my colleagues not to move, and I addressed the warder: I would like you to produce the document from the commissioner of prisons authorizing our pictures to be taken. Photographs of prisoners required such authorization.   It was always valuable to be familiar with regulations, because the warders themselves were often ignorant of them and could be intimidated by ones superior knowledge. The warder was taken aback by my request and was unable to offer any explanation or produce anything in writing from the commissioner of prisons. He threatened to charge us if we did not consent to have our photographs taken, but I said that if there was no authorization, there would be no pictures, and that is where the matter remained.   As a rule, we objected to having our pictures taken in prison on the grounds that it is generally demeaning to be seen as a prisoner. But there was one photograph I did consent to, the only one I ever agreed to while on Robben Island.   One morning, a few weeks later, the chief warder, instead of handing us hammers for our work in the courtyard, gave us each needles and thread and a pile of worn prison jerseys. We were instructed to repair the garments, but we discovered that most of these jerseys were frayed beyond repair. This struck us as a curious task, and we wondered what had provoked the change. Later that morning, at about eleven oclock, the front gate swung open, revealing the commanding officer with two men in suits. The

DETAILED ANSWER: 

==========

RESPONSE:

The passage describes the conditions in which the prisoners on Robben Island lived. They were given meager amounts of food, and the food they did receive was often of poor quality. The prisoners were also not allowed to have any lights in their cells, and they were only allowed to talk to each other quietly. However, the prisoners were able to smuggle food and other contraband into their cells. The passage then describes an incident in which the prisoners were ordered to have their fingerprints taken. However, when the prisoners saw that the warders were also taking pictures of them, they refused to have their pictures taken. The warders did not have the authorization to take the pictures, so the prisoners refused to cooperate. The passage ends with a description of a curious task that the prisoners were given one day. They were given needles and thread and told to repair some worn prison jerseys. However, most of the jerseys were beyond repair. The prisoners wondered what had prompted the change. Later that day, they found out that the commanding officer had come to visit the prison with two men in suits.

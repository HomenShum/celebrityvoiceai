PASSAGE: was surprised but not displeased to see him. I was pessimistic about the marriage and I thought it only fair to inform him of my feelings.     We were discussing this issue cordially among the three of us, when either Walter or I used a phrase like Men such as ourselves, or something of that ilk. Evelyns brother-in-law was a businessman, opposed to politics and politicians. He became very huffy and said, If you chaps think you are in the same position as myself, that is ridiculous. Do not compare yourselves to me. When he left, Walter and I looked at each other and started laughing.     After we were arrested in December and kept in prison for two weeks, I had one visit from Evelyn. But when I came out of prison, I found that she had moved out and taken the children. I returned to an empty, silent house. She had even removed the curtains, and for some reason I found this small detail shattering. Evelyn had moved in with her brother, who told me, Perhaps it is for the best; maybe when things will have cooled down you will come back together. It was reasonable advice, but it was not to be.     Evelyn and I had irreconcilable differences. I could not give up my life in the struggle, and she could not live with my devotion to something other than herself and the family. She was a very good woman, charming, strong, and faithful, and a fine mother. I never lost my respect and admiration for her, but in the end, we could not make our marriage work.     The breakup of any marriage is traumatic, especially for the children. Our family was no exception, and all of the children were wounded by our separation. Makgatho took to sleeping in my bed. He was a gentle child, a natural peacemaker and he tried to bring about some sort of reconciliation between me and his mother. Makaziwe was still very small, and I remember one day, when I was not in prison or in court, I visited her crche (nursery school) unannounced. She had always been a very affectionate child, but that day, when she saw me, she froze. She did not know whether to run to me or retreat, to smile or frown. She had some conflict in her small heart, which she did not know how to resolve. It was very painful.     Thembi, who was ten at the time, was the most deeply affected.

One time, Walter took him to an event, and afterward Walter said to me, Man, that chap is quiet. Following the breakup, Thembi would frequently wear my clothes, even though they were far too large for him; they gave him some kind of attachment to his too-often-distant father.                                                                            25 ON JANUARY 9, 1957, we once again assembled in the Drill Hall. It was the defenses turn to refute the states charges. After summarizing the Crowns case against us, Vernon Berrang, our lead counsel, announced our argument. The defense, he said, will strenuously repudiate that the terms of the Freedom Charter are treasonable or criminal. On the contrary, the defense will contend that the ideas and beliefs which are expressed in this charter, although repugnant to the policy of the present government, are such as are shared by the overwhelming majority of mankind of all races and colors, and also by the overwhelming majority of the citizens of this country. In consultation with our attorneys, we had decided that we were not merely going to prove that we were innocent of treason, but that this was a political trial in which the government was persecuting us for

QUESTION: what do you think about the issue regarding injustice

PASSAGE: the municipal councils.     WITNESS: Yes.     NM: Africans have no vote in this country?     WITNESS: They have got no vote as far as Parliament is concerned.     NM: Yes, that is what I am talking about, I am talking about Parliament and other government bodies of the country, the provincial councils, the municipal councils. They have no       vote?     WITNESS: That is right.     NM: Would you agree with me that in any civilized country in the world it would be scandalous for a prime minister to fail to reply to a letter raising vital issues affecting the majority of       the citizens of that country. Would you agree with that?     WITNESS: I dont agree with that.     NM: You dont agree that it would be irregular for a prime minister to ignore a letter raising vital issues affecting the vast majority of the citizens of that country?     WITNESS: This letter has not been ignored by the prime minister.     NM: Just answer the question. Do you regard it proper for a prime minister not to respond to pleas made in regard to vital issues by the vast majority of the citizens of the country?       You say that is wrong?     WITNESS: The prime minister did respond to the letter.     NM: Mr. Barnard, I dont want to be rude to you. Will you confine yourself to answering my questions. The question I am putting to you is, do you agree that it is most improper on the       part of a prime minister not to reply to a communication raising vital issues affecting the vast majority of the country?     Mr. Barnard and I never did agree. In the end, he simply said that the tone of the letter was aggressive and discourteous and for that reason the prime minister did not answer it.                                                                                           * * * Throughout the proceedings the prosecutor and the magistrate repeatedly inquired about the number of witnesses I intended to call. I would always reply, I plan to call as many witnesses as the state, if not more. When the state finally concluded its case, there was a stillness in the courtroom in anticipation of the beginning of my defense. I rose and instead of calling my first witness, I declared quite matter-of-factly that I was not calling any witnesses at all, at which point I abruptly closed my case. There was a murmur in the courtroom and the prosecutor could not help exclaiming, Lord!    I had misled the court from the beginning because I knew the charge was accurate and the states case was solid, and I saw no point in attempting to call witnesses and defend myself. Through my cross-examination and attempts to force the judge to recuse himself, I had made the statements I wanted about the unfairness of the court. I saw no advantage in calling witnesses to try to disprove something that was incontrovertible.    The magistrate was taken by surprise by my action and asked me with some incredulity, Have you anything more to say?    Your Worship, I submit that I am guilty of no crime.    Is that all you have to say?    Your Worship, with respect, if I had something more to say I would have said it.    The prosecutor then shuffled through his papers attempting to get ready for an address he did not expect to have to make. He briefly addressed the court and asked the magistrate to find me guilty on both counts. The court was then adjourned until the following day, when I would have a chance to address the court in what is known as the plea in mitigation before the magistrate gave his sentence.   The following morning, before court was called into session, I was in an office off the courtroom talking with Bob Hepple, who had been advising me on the case, and we were praising the fact that the day before, the General Assembly of the U.N. had voted in favor of sanctions against South Africa for the first time. Bob also told me that acts of sabotage in Port Elizabeth and Durban had occurred, both celebrating the U.N. vote and protesting my trial. We were in the

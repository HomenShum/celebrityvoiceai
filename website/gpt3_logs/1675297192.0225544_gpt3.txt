PROMPT:

The author describes the conditions at Pollsmoor Prison, which were much better than those on Robben Island. The author notes that the prisoners on Robben Island were treated better than the common-law prisoners at Pollsmoor. The author also describes the prisoners' penthouse, which was clean and modern, and had a separate section with a toilet, urinal, two sinks, and two showers. The author describes the L-shaped terrace, which was an open, outdoor section that was as long as half a soccer field, where the prisoners were allowed out during the day. The author notes that the terrace had white concrete walls about twelve feet high, so that the prisoners could see only the sky.  I liked that Pollsmoor had superior food and that we were allowed out on the terrace all day. I also liked that we had a radio and that the visiting area was far better and more modern than the one on Robben Island.  I liked the camaraderie among the prisoners. We would often sing while washing, which made the water seem less icy. In those early days, this was one of the only times that we could converse. I also liked that we were able to work in the courtyard. It was a nice break from being in our cells all day.  The author liked that prison brought people together and that they had to fight for their survival. He also liked that prison was a microcosm of the larger struggle against racism and repression. Finally, the author liked that prison taught him to be an optimist and to keep his head up even in dark moments.  I liked that the prison had a reputation for being a model facility. I liked that it was located in a beautiful, old Cape Dutch town. I liked that it had a large, spacious lounge and a large bedroom. I liked that it had a swimming pool in the backyard. I liked that it was sparsely but comfortably furnished. I liked that it was visited by Kobie Coetsee, who brought a case of Cape wine as a housewarming gift. I liked that the cottage gave one the illusion of freedom. I liked that I could go to sleep and wake up as I pleased, swim whenever I wanted, and eat when I was hungry. I liked that there were no bars on the windows and no doors to lock or unlock.

RESPONSE:

I was very pleased with the conditions at Pollsmoor Prison. It was a great improvement over the conditions on Robben Island. The food was better and we were allowed out on the terrace all day. We also had a radio and the visiting area was far better and more modern than on Robben Island. I liked the camaraderie among the prisoners. We would often sing while washing, which made the water seem less icy. In those early days, this was one of the only times that we could converse. I also liked that we were able to work in the courtyard. It was a nice break from being in our cells all day.

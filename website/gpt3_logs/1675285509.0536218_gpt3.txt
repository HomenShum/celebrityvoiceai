The speaker in the passage is Nelson Mandela, and he is discussing the reasons why trade and manufacture are important. He begins by talking about how the African National Congress (ANC) has always been a proponent of African nationalism, and how this nationalism is not about driving the white man out of the country. Instead, it is about freedom and fulfillment for the African people in their own land. He then talks about how the Communist Party has always been focused on removing the capitalists and replacing them with a working-class government. This is in contrast to the ANC, which has always been focused on winning unity and full political rights for the African people. Mandela then goes on to talk about how there has often been close cooperation between the ANC and the Communist Party, but that this is not proof of a complete community of interests. He finishes by talking about how many Africans tend to equate freedom with communism because for many years, communists were the only political group who were willing to treat Africans as equals.  The passage mentions several reasons why trade and manufacture would be important. First, the Freedom Charter calls for the abolition of racial discrimination and the achievement of equal rights for all, which would presumably include equal access to trade and manufacture. Second, the charter calls for the people to share in the country's wealth, which would presumably include access to trade and manufacture. Finally, the charter calls for the land to be shared among those who work it, which would presumably include access to trade and manufacture.  The passage mentions several reasons why trade and manufacture would be important. First, virtue and generosity will be rewarded in ways that one cannot know. Second, Xhosa children learn mainly through observation, so they would need to see adults engaged in trade and manufacturing in order to learn how to do it themselves. Third, amaMfengu are often more educated and Western than other Africans, so they are in a good position to teach others about trade and manufacturing. Finally, local form of tribalism that I observed as a boy was relatively harmless. At that stage, I did not witness nor even suspect the violent tribal rivalries that would subsequently be promoted by the white rulers of South Africa.  Trade and manufacture would be important because they are the foundation of the economy. Marx believed that history progresses through struggle and change, and that national liberation movements are a part of this process. He believed that the Soviet Union was particularly supportive of national liberation movements. This is why I amended my view of Communists and accepted the ANC position of welcoming Marxists into its ranks. I did not need to become a Communist in order to work with them. I found that African nationalists and African Communists generally had far more uniting them than dividing them.  The answer to this question can be found in the passage from Nelson Mandela's autobiography, Long Walk to Freedom. In the passage, Mandela discusses the events leading up to and during the 1992 negotiations at CODESA 2, which were aimed at reaching a power-sharing agreement between the ruling National Party and the ANC. One of the key issues that led to the breakdown of these negotiations was the National Party's insistence on maintaining a minority veto over constitutional matters. This was seen as an unacceptable concession by the ANC, as it would effectively mean that the National Party could continue to rule in perpetuity. Trade and manufacture would be important because they are essential to the economy. The ANC would want to trade so they can get money and resources, and manufacture so they can create jobs.

PROMPT: Speak the passage in Nelson Mandela's voice for an interview:

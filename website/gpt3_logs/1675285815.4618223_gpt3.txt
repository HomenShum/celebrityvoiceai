PROMPT:

The passage describes the author's experience of being moved from Robben Island to Pollsmoor Prison. The author notes that the move was sudden and without explanation, and that it was disorienting. The author and the other prisoners were given a spacious room with beds and towels, which was a luxury compared to their previous accommodations on Robben Island. The author notes that the move made them feel more isolated, as Robben Island had become the locus of the struggle for them.  My experience in prison was difficult but also eye-opening. I learned the importance of routine and how it can be both a trap and a comfort. I also learned how to survive in prison and how to emerge from it unchanged.  The author's experience in prison was one of constantly trying to find ways to get news, as news was extremely valuable to political prisoners. The author describes how newspapers were often smuggled in, usually by bribing warders or retrieving them from the trash. One time, the author was caught with a newspaper and sentenced to three days in isolation. The author does not believe that they were set up, as the authorities would have known how the newspaper was obtained if that were the case.  The experience in prison was not a good one according to the passage. The passage describes a meeting with a representative from the American Bar Association, Mr. Hynning. Mr. Hynning was unkempt, sweaty, and spoke with a southern American accent. He also had a habit of spitting when he talked. The author and the other prisoners were not impressed with Mr. Hynning and found him to be demoralizing.  The speaker's experience in prison was one of isolation and dehumanization. He was stripped of his clothes and given the standard prison uniform for Africans, which included short trousers. He refused to wear the shorts, and as a result was put in isolation. He was locked up for 23 hours a day, with only 30 minutes of exercise in the morning and afternoon. He had no natural light in his cell, and no way to tell time. He was also not allowed to have any reading material or anything to write on. The only contact he had with another human being was with his African warder, whom he tried to bribe with an apple to get him to talk to him. After a few weeks, he was ready to trade his long trousers for some company. He eventually was put with the other political prisoners, including Robert Sobukwe. He was glad to be able to talk to them and forge a unity that he thought would be difficult to achieve on the outside.

The passage discusses the long road to freedom, and how it is a never-ending journey. The speaker has made mistakes along the way, but has kept going. They take a moment to appreciate how far they have come, but know that there is still more work to do. Freedom comes with responsibilities, and so the speaker cannot linger.  The passage describes a situation in which the narrator, a political prisoner, is mediating between Jimmy, another prisoner, and an officer. Jimmy is upset because the officer has refused to give him a letter, and the narrator is trying to calm him down. The officer eventually hands over the letter, and the narrator and Jimmy leave the office. The passage then goes on to describe the prisoners' work collecting seaweed. They are able to admire the view of Cape Town while they work. The work is sometimes difficult, but it is still preferable to working in the quarry. The ocean proves to be a treasure chest for the prisoners, who find beautiful shells and coral. They also find a bottle of wine that is still corked.  At the press conference, Mandela explained that he had not negotiated with the government about the future of the country, except to insist on a meeting between the ANC and the government. He said that he hoped a climate conducive to a negotiated settlement could be achieved, which would end the need for the armed struggle. He outlined the steps that would need to be taken to achieve this, including the immediate end of the State of Emergency and the release of all political prisoners. He also called de Klerk a man of integrity.  The Rivonia Trial was a highly publicized case in which a group of men were accused of high treason and various other charges related to their work with the African National Congress (ANC) and its military wing, the Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK). The trial took place in 1963-64, and the men facing charges included Nelson Mandela. During the trial, one of the prosecution's witnesses, Andrew Mlangeni, made an unsworn statement admitting that he had carried messages and instructions for MK, and had disguised himself as a priest to facilitate this work. He also informed the court that he had been assaulted while in prison and subjected to electric shock treatment. The prosecution's case rested on the claim that the accused had undertaken preparations for guerrilla warfare, and that the ANC and MK were the same organization. However, defense counsel Arthur Chaskalson pointed out that the prosecution had failed to prove these claims, and that MK's express policy was that there should be no loss of life. Bram Fischer, another defense counsel, argued that the two organizations were separate. Judge de Wet agreed with both of these points, and adjourned the court for three weeks while he considered the verdict. The trial garnered international attention, and there were night-long vigils held for the accused at St. Pauls Cathedral in London. The students of London University even elected Nelson Mandela as their president, in absentia.  The passage describes the conditions in which the prisoners on Robben Island lived. They were given meager amounts of food, and the food they did receive was often of poor quality. The prisoners were also not allowed to have any lights in their cells, and they were only allowed to talk to each other quietly. However, the prisoners were able to smuggle food and other contraband into their cells. The passage then describes an incident in which the prisoners were ordered to have their fingerprints taken. However, when the prisoners saw that the warders were also taking pictures of them, they refused to have their pictures taken. The warders did not have the authorization to take the pictures, so the prisoners refused to cooperate. The passage ends with a description of a curious task that the prisoners were given one day. They were given needles and thread and told to repair some worn prison jerseys. However, most of the jerseys were beyond repair. The prisoners wondered what had prompted the change. Later that day, they found out that the commanding officer had come to visit the prison with two men in suits.

RESPONSE:

I was a political prisoner on Robben Island for many years. The conditions were very difficult, but we managed to get by. We were given meager amounts of food, and the food we did receive was often of poor quality. We were not allowed to have any lights in our cells, and we were only allowed to talk to each other quietly. However, we were able to smuggle food and other contraband into our cells. One day, we were ordered to have our fingerprints taken. However, when we saw that the warders were also taking pictures of us, we refused to have our pictures taken. The warders did not have the authorization to take the pictures, so we refused to cooperate. Later that day, we found out that the commanding officer had come to visit the prison with two men in suits.

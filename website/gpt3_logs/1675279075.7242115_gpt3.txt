In his response, Mandela discusses the Defiance Campaign, a mass protest movement against the discrimination of black South Africans that he was a part of. He argues that the campaign was successful in uniting the ANC and raising awareness of their cause, but that it ultimately fizzled out because it was not well-organized. He believes that the ANC needs to learn from their mistakes and be better prepared for future campaigns.  The passage discusses the formation of the Congress of the People, an organization created in order to gather suggestions for a new constitution in South Africa. The Congress was formed in response to the realization that the government was likely to ban the ANC, and it was hoped that the Congress would be a public display of strength that would unite all the oppressed and progressive forces in South Africa. The National Action Council, composed of representatives from four sponsoring organizations, was created in order to invite all participating organizations to send suggestions for a freedom charter. Circulars were sent out to townships and villages across the country, asking people what they would do if they could make the laws. The call caught the imagination of the people, and suggestions came in from all over.  Nelson Mandela suggests that the focus should be on African nationalism and on ending chauvinistic and violent nationalism. He also suggests that Marxists should be welcomed into the ranks of the ANC in order to speed up the process of erasing human prejudice.  Nelson Mandela believes that we should focus on freedom for all people, regardless of race, as our society's next goal. He notes that even though some may say that freedom has already been achieved, there is still much work to be done in order to truly achieve equality and freedom for all.

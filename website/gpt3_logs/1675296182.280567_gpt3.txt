There are a number of reasons why crime and violence are big problems today. One reason is that there is a lot of dissent and tension within society. When people feel like they are not being heard or that their concerns are not being addressed, they may lash out in anger and violence. Another reason why crime and violence are big problems today is that there is a lot of inequality in society. When people feel like they are not getting a fair share of resources or opportunities, they may resort to crime in order to get what they feel they deserve. Finally, another reason why crime and violence are big problems today is that there is a lot of uncertainty and insecurity in the world. When people feel like they do not have a stable or secure future, they may be more likely to engage in criminal activity in order to survive.  Crime and violence are big problems today because they are perpetuated by a cycle of poverty, lack of opportunity, and poor decision-making. This cycle is perpetuated by a number of factors, including the presence of gangs, the illegal drug trade, and the easy availability of guns. Poverty is a major factor in crime and violence. Poor people are more likely to resort to crime in order to make ends meet, and they are also more likely to be victims of crime. Lack of opportunity is another factor that contributes to crime and violence. People who feel that they have no legitimate way to improve their lives are more likely to turn to crime. Poor decision-making is also a major factor in crime and violence. People who make poor decisions, such as choosing to join a gang or using drugs, are more likely to be involved in crime.  There are a variety of reasons why crime and violence are big problems today. One reason is that there is a lack of educational opportunities for many people. This is especially true for people from disadvantaged backgrounds. The Nationalist government in South Africa passed the Bantu Education Act in 1953, which put apartheid's stamp on African education. This act transferred control of African education from the Department of Education to the Native Affairs Department. Under the act, African primary and secondary schools operated by the church and mission bodies were given the choice of turning over their control to the government. This led to a decline in the quality of education for Africans. As a result, many people do not have the skills or knowledge they need to get jobs and support themselves. This can lead to frustration and desperation, which can in turn lead to crime and violence.  There are many reasons why crime and violence are big problems today. One reason is that there is a lot of inequality in society. This means that some people have a lot of money and power, while others have very little. This can lead to frustration and anger, which can in turn lead to crime and violence. Another reason why crime and violence are big problems today is that there are a lot of guns and other weapons available. This means that people can easily hurt or kill other people. Finally, another reason why crime and violence are big problems today is that some people have mental health problems. This can make them more likely to act violently.  The passage explains that crime and violence are big problems today because people are not truly free. People are oppressed and have their freedom taken away from them, which leads to a desire for freedom that can manifest itself in crime and violence.

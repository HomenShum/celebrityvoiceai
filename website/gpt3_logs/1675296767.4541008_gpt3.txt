PROMPT:

The first step in changing the culture that glamorizes violence is education. Education is the great engine of personal development. It is through education that the daughter of a peasant can become a doctor, that the son of a mineworker can become the head of the mine, that a child of farmworkers can become the president of a great nation. It is what we make out of what we have, not what we are given, that separates one person from another. Since the turn of the century, Africans owed their educational opportunites primarily to the foreign churches and missions that created and sponsored schools. Under the United Party, the syllabus for African secondary schools and white secondary schools was essentially the same. The mission schools provided Africans with Western-style English-language education, which I myself received. We were limited by lesser facilities but not by what we could read or think or dream. Yet, even before the Nationalists came to power, the disparities in funding tell a story of racist education. The government spent about six times as much per white student as per African student. Education was not compulsory for Africans and was free only in the primary grades. Less than half of all African children of school age attended any school at all, and only a tiny number of Africans were graduated from high school. Even this amount of education proved distasteful to the Nationalists. The Afrikaner has always been unenthusiastic about education for Africans. To him it was simply a waste, for the African was inherently ignorant and lazy and no amount of education could remedy that. The Afrikaner was traditionally hostile to Africans learning English, for English was a foreign tongue to the Afrikaner and the language of emancipation to us. In 1953, the Nationalist-dominated Parliament passed the Bantu Education Act, which sought to put apartheids stamp on African education. The act transferred control of African education from the Department of Education to the much loathed Native Affairs Department. Under the act, African primary and secondary schools operated by the church and mission bodies were given the choice of turning over their  The author argues that violence is not the best way to achieve a nonracial state, but that it is necessary to prepare for the possibility of guerrilla warfare. He recommends building up a nucleus of trained men who would be able to provide the leadership which would be required if guerrilla warfare started.  The passage discusses Nelson Mandela's thoughts on how to change the culture that glamorizes violence. He begins by saying that the government is scared of the African people and that violence is the only weapon that will destroy apartheid. He then says that the time for passive resistance has ended and that nonviolence is a useless strategy. He concludes by saying that his words that night did not come out of nowhere and that he had been thinking of the future. Mandela's thoughts on changing the culture that glamorizes violence are complex. On the one hand, he believes that violence is the only way to destroy apartheid. On the other hand, he also believes that nonviolence is a useless strategy. Ultimately, he seems to believe that both legal and extra-constitutional protests will soon be impossible and that a police state is not far off. These thoughts are controversial and would likely provoke a strong reaction from both the government and the general public.  In order to change the culture that glamorizes violence, we need to work together to create a more peaceful and tolerant world. We can start by teaching people about the harmful effects of violence, and by working to promote non-violent conflict resolution. We can also support organizations that are working to end violence, and we can speak out against violence whenever we see it happening.  There are a few things we can do to change the culture that glamorizes violence. One is to provide more positive role models for young people to look up to. This can be done through the media, by featuring more stories about people who have made a difference through non-violent means. Another way to change the culture is to provide more education about the negative consequences of violence, both in the short and long term. This education can happen in schools, but also through community programs and outreach. Finally, we can work to change the social norms around violence, by speaking out against it whenever we see it happening and working to create more peaceful communities.

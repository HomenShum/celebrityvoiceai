QUESTION: how should we work to change the culture that glamorizes violence?

PASSAGE: of others. The true test of our devotion to freedom is just beginning.    I have walked that long road to freedom. I have tried not to falter; I have made missteps along the way. But I have discovered the secret that after climbing a great hill, one only finds that there are many more hills to climb. I have taken a moment here to rest, to steal a view of the glorious vista that surrounds me, to look back on the distance I have come. But I can rest only for a moment, for with freedom come responsibilities, and I dare not linger, for my long walk is not yet ended.

DETAILED ANSWER:

RESPONSE:

In order to change the culture that glamorizes violence, we need to work together to create a more peaceful and tolerant world. We can start by teaching people about the harmful effects of violence, and by working to promote non-violent conflict resolution. We can also support organizations that are working to end violence, and we can speak out against violence whenever we see it happening.

PROMPT:

I am doing well, considering my age. I have regular medical check-ups and I have been told I'm in good health for the time being. My knees are my only issue, as they were injured during my time in prison and I have some bone chips between the joints. My doctors have advised against an operation, and I have no pain when walking, so I'm managing. When I look back on my life, I leave it up to future generations to judge how remarkable it was. I like to visit prisons to see people and make them happy, but I also enjoy reflecting on my past and present. During my time in prison, I had the opportunity to reflect on my relationships with others and my own personal worth. This reflection made me realize that if someone does something good for you, you must respond in kind. Now, when I wake up each day, my purpose is to give as much as possible to those who need it most. This includes building schools, clinics, community halls, and arranging scholarships for children in need. Of course, I also have duties to my family which are important to me. Although making up for all the years I wasn't there to help is not at the top of my mind, it is my goal to spend the rest of my life helping those who are less fortunate and bringing a little happiness into their lives.  I am doing very well, thank you. I am retired now and have left everything to President Thabo Mbeki who is doing a remarkable job. I am still involved in some activities on the fringes, which I enjoy, and I am currently writing my memoirs of the presidential years. My health is good and I feel on top of the world. I have six grandchildren, four great grandchildren, and 29 grandchildren. I met my current wife when I went to Mozambique in 1990 and she is a wonderful lady. I am very happy with her.  I am doing well, all things considered. Despite the difficult circumstances, I am grateful for the small comforts and freedoms I have. I recently had to take a long journey in a military transport plane, but the scenery was beautiful, and I was able to take in the sights of my beloved homeland. Upon arriving at Robben Island, we were met with tense guards and harsh commands, but despite the cold winter wind and the indignity of changing into prison uniforms, I have been able to stay strong and keep my spirits up.  I am doing as well as can be expected. Despite the difficult circumstances of prison life, I am grateful for the moments of joy I experience when I am visited by my family. It was a great pleasure to see my son and daughter who had grown into adults while I had been away. However, my mother's physical condition concerned me and I feared it would be the last time I saw her. Unfortunately, I was right and soon after, I received a telegram informing me that she had passed away due to a heart attack. Although I requested to attend her funeral in the Transkei, the commanding officer denied my request. Despite this heavy loss and the harshness of my current situation, I continue to strive for justice and peace for all people.  I am doing well, thank you. While in prison, I used the time to reflect on my life and the choices I had made. I was able to think deeply about how I had been so busy that I had forgotten about those who had been so kind and hospitable to me when I first moved to Johannesburg. It was a humbling experience that drove me to strive for justice for all. We were allowed visitors, but not conjugal visits as we were separated by a glass wall and closely watched. When I was moved to a different prison, my wife was allowed to stay with me, but she refused out of respect for my colleagues who did not have the same privilege. This demonstrated the compassion and selflessness that drove us in our fight against the system.

PROMPT: Summarize the passage into an interview response in Nelson Mandela's voice that is love, selflessness, forgiveness, tolerance, compassion, fairness, humility, a yearning for justice as well as one of being a champion of human rights.

RESPONSE:

I am humbled and thankful for the love, selflessness, forgiveness, tolerance, compassion, fairness, and humility of those around me. Throughout my life, I have strived for justice and human rights for all people. I have seen the power of love in action as my wife refused conjugal visits out of respect for my colleagues and have witnessed the strength of selflessness in the face of adversity. My journey has been filled with moments of joy and sorrow, but I remain committed to fighting for equality and justice for all.

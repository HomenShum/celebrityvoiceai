PASSAGE: made an unsworn statement admitting that he carried messages and instructions for MK and had disguised himself as a priest to facilitate this work. He, too, informed the court that he had been assaulted while in prison, and subjected to electric shock treatment. Andrew was the last witness. The defense rested. All that remained were the final arguments and then judgment.   On the twentieth of May, Yutar handed out a dozen blue leather-bound volumes of his final speech to the press and one to the defense. Despite its handsome packaging, Yutars address was a garbled summary of the prosecutions case and did not explain the indictment or assess the  evidence. It was filled with ad hominem insults. The deceit of the accused is amazing, he said at one point. Although they represented scarcely 1% of the Bantu population they took it upon themselves to tell the world that the Africans in South Africa are suppressed, oppressed and depressed. Even Judge de Wet seemed mystified by Yutars speech, and at one point interrupted him to say, Mr. Yutar, you do concede that you failed to prove guerrilla warfare was ever decided upon, do you not?    Yutar was stunned. He had assumed precisely the opposite. We were surprised as well, for the judges question gave us hope. Yutar haltingly told the court that preparations for guerrilla warfare were indeed made.    Yes, I know that, de Wet replied impatiently, the defense concedes that. But they say that prior to their arrest they took no decision to engage in guerrilla warfare. I take it that you have no evidence contradicting that and that you accept it?    As Your Worship wishes, Yutar said in a strangled voice.    Yutar finished by saying that the case was not only one of high treason par excellence, but of murder and attempted murder  neither of which was mentioned in the indictment. In a fit of bluster, he proclaimed, I make bold to say that every particular allegation in the indictment has been proved. He knew, even as he uttered those words, that they were patently false.   Defense counsel Arthur Chaskalson rose first to deal with some of the legal questions raised by the prosecution. He rejected Yutars statement that the trial had anything to do with murder, and reminded the court that MKs express policy was that there should be no loss of life. When Arthur began to explain that other organizations committed acts of sabotage for which the accused were blamed, de Wet interrupted to say he already accepted that as a fact. This was another unexpected victory.    Bram Fischer spoke next and was prepared to tackle the states two most serious contentions: that we had undertaken guerrilla warfare and that the ANC and MK were the same. Though de Wet had said he believed that guerrilla warfare had not yet begun, we were taking no chances. But as Bram launched into his first point, de Wet interjected somewhat testily, I thought I made my attitude clear. I accept that no decision or date was fixed upon for guerrilla warfare.    When Bram began his second point, de Wet again interrupted him to say that he also conceded the fact that the two organizations were separate. Bram, who was usually prepared for anything, was hardly prepared for de Wets response. He then sat down; the judge had accepted his arguments even before he made them. We were jubilant  that is, if men facing the death sentence can be said to be jubilant. Court was adjourned for three weeks while de Wet considered the verdict.                                                                             57 THE WORLD had been paying attention to the Rivonia Trial.

DETAILED ANSWER:

RESPONSE:

The Rivonia Trial was a highly publicized case in which a group of men were accused of high treason and various other charges related to their work with the African National Congress (ANC) and its military wing, the Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK). The trial took place in 1963-64, and the men facing charges included Nelson Mandela. During the trial, one of the prosecution's witnesses, Andrew Mlangeni, made an unsworn statement admitting that he had carried messages and instructions for MK, and had disguised himself as a priest to facilitate this work. He also informed the court that he had been assaulted while in prison and subjected to electric shock treatment. The prosecution's case rested on the claim that the accused had undertaken preparations for guerrilla warfare, and that the ANC and MK were the same organization. However, defense counsel Arthur Chaskalson pointed out that the prosecution had failed to prove these claims, and that MK's express policy was that there should be no loss of life. Bram Fischer, another defense counsel, argued that the two organizations were separate. Judge de Wet agreed with both of these points, and adjourned the court for three weeks while he considered the verdict. The trial garnered international attention, and there were night-long vigils held for the accused at St. Pauls Cathedral in London. The students of London University even elected Nelson Mandela as their president, in absentia.

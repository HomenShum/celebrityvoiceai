QUESTION: hello how are you!

PASSAGE: was calm. Weve been sent by Mr. Wellbeloved, he replied, his tone bordering on defiance. Mr. Piliso considered this for a moment.  Did you tell him that you ran away from your father? Piliso then countered. Justice was silent.    Youll never be employed in any mine that I run! he yelled. Now, get out of my sight! Justice waved Wellbeloveds letter. I dont give a damn about a letter! Piliso said. I looked to the white manager, hoping that he might overrule Piliso, but he was as still as a statue and seemed as intimidated as we were. We had no rejoinder for Piliso, and we sheepishly walked out of the office, feeling even more humbled than we had on the first occasion.    Our fortunes were now reversed. We were without jobs, without prospects, and without a place to stay. Justice knew various people in Johannesburg, and he went into town to investigate a place for us to stay. In the meantime, I was to fetch our suitcase, which was still at Pilisos, and then meet Justice at George Goch, a small township in southern Johannesburg, later that day.    I prevailed upon a fellow named Bikitsha, whom I knew from home, to help me carry the suitcase to the front gate. A watchman at the gate stopped us both and said he needed to search the bag. Bikitsha protested, asserting there was no contraband in the suitcase. The watchman replied that a search was routine, and he looked through the bag in a cursory way, not even disturbing the clothing. As the watchman was closing it, Bikitsha, who was a cocky fellow, said, Why do you make trouble? I told you there was nothing there. These words irked the watchman, who then decided to search the case with a fine-toothed comb. I became increasingly nervous as he opened every compartment and probed every pocket. He then reached all the way to the bottom of the case and found the very thing I prayed he would not: a loaded revolver wrapped inside some of my clothing.    He turned to my friend and said, You are under arrest. He then blew his whistle, which brought a team of guards over to us. My friend looked at me with a mixture of consternation and confusion as they led him away to the local police station. I followed them at a distance, considering my options. The gun, an old revolver, had been my fathers and he had left it to me when he died. I had never used it, but as a precaution, I had brought it with me to the city.    I could not let my friend take the blame in my stead. Not long after he had entered the police station, I went inside and asked to see the officer in charge. I was taken to him and spoke as directly and forthrightly as I could: Sir, that is my gun that was found in my friends suitcase. I inherited it from my father in the Transkei and I brought it here because I was afraid of gangsters. I explained that I was a student from Fort Hare, and that I was only in Johannesburg temporarily. The officer in charge softened a bit as I spoke, and said that he would release my friend straightaway. He said he would have to charge me for possession of the gun, though he would not arrest me, and that I should appear in court first thing on Monday morning to answer the charge. I was grateful, and told him that I would certainly appear in court on Monday. I did go to court that Monday and received only a nominal fine.    In the meantime, I had arranged to stay with one of my cousins, Garlick Mbekeni, in George Goch Township. Garlick was a hawker who sold clothing, and had a small boxlike house. He was a friendly, solicitous man, and after I had been there a short while, I told him that my real aspiration was to be a lawyer. He commended me for my ambition and said he would think about what I had said.    A few days later, Garlick told me that he was taking me to see one of our best people in Johannesburg. We rode the train to the office of an estate agent on Market Street, a dense and rollicking thoroughfare with trams groaning with passengers, sidewalk vendors on every street,

RESPONSE:

The passage begins with the narrator recounting how he and his friend, Justice, were recently fired from their jobs at a mine. They went to speak with the mine manager, Mr. Piliso, in hopes of being rehired, but Piliso was unyielding. He told them that they would never be employed at his mine again and ordered them to leave. The narrator goes on to say that he and Justice then had to figure out where to stay in Johannesburg. Justice knew some people in the city and went to ask around for a place to stay, while the narrator was tasked with fetching their suitcase from Piliso's house. On his way to Piliso's house, the narrator enlists the help of a friend, Bikitsha, to carry the suitcase. When they arrive at the house, the watchman at the gate decides to search the suitcase. He finds a loaded revolver wrapped in some of the narrator's clothing. The watchman arrests Bikitsha and takes him to the police station. The narrator follows them to the police station and then tells the officer in charge that the gun is actually his and that Bikitsha is innocent. The officer releases Bikitsha and tells the narrator that he will have to appear in court on Monday to answer for possession of the gun. The narrator goes on to say that he arranged to stay with a cousin in George Goch Township. A few days later, his cousin took him to meet with an estate agent on Market Street.

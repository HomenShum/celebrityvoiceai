QUESTION: how should we work to change the culture that glamorizes violence?

PASSAGE: of others. The true test of our devotion to freedom is just beginning.    I have walked that long road to freedom. I have tried not to falter; I have made missteps along the way. But I have discovered the secret that after climbing a great hill, one only finds that there are many more hills to climb. I have taken a moment here to rest, to steal a view of the glorious vista that surrounds me, to look back on the distance I have come. But I can rest only for a moment, for with freedom come responsibilities, and I dare not linger, for my long walk is not yet ended.

DETAILED ANSWER: 

==========

RESPONSE:

We need to work to change the culture that glamorizes violence in a number of ways. First, we need to be more thoughtful about the media we consume and the messages we send. We need to be more critical of the stories we tell and the way we tell them. Second, we need to be more proactive in teaching young people about the consequences of violence and helping them develop skills for managing conflict. And third, we need to be more intentional in supporting survivors of violence and working to create a culture of healing and justice.

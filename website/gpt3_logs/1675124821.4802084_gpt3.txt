Summarize the following as an interview script response using Nelson Mandela's voice:

QUESTION: The last time we talked, you said that if you hadn't been in prison, you wouldn't have achieved the most difficult task in life - changing yourself. How did 27 years of reflection make you a different man?

PASSAGE: older brother, my first and oldest son, Madiba Thembekile, whom we called Thembi, had been killed in a motorcar accident in the Transkei. Thembi was then twenty-five years old, and the father of two small children.     What can one say about such a tragedy? I was already overwrought about my wife, I was still grieving for my mother, and then to hear such news . . . I do not have words to express the sorrow, or the loss I felt. It left a hole in my heart that can never be filled.     I returned to my cell and lay on my bed. I do not know how long I stayed there, but I did not emerge for dinner. Some of the men looked in, but I said nothing. Finally, Walter came to me and knelt beside my bed, and I handed him the telegram. He said nothing, but only held my hand. I do not know how long he remained with me. There is nothing that one man can say to another at such a time.     I asked permission of the authorities to attend my sons funeral. As a father, it was my responsibility to make sure that my sons spirit would rest peacefully. I told them they could send a security cordon with me, and that I would give my word that I would return. Permission was denied. All I was permitted to do was write a letter to Thembis mother, Evelyn, in which I did my best to comfort her and tell her that I shared her suffering.     I thought back to one afternoon when Thembi was a boy and he came to visit me at a safe house in Cyrildene that I used for secret ANC work. Between my underground political work and legal cases, I had not been able to see him for some time. I surprised him at the house and found him wearing an old jacket of mine that came to his knees. He must have taken some comfort and pride in wearing his fathers clothing, just as I once did with my own fathers. When I had to say good-bye again, he stood up tall, as if he were already grown, and said, I will look after the family while you  are gone.

Progress was halting, and typically accompanied by setbacks. An advancement might take years to win, and then be rescinded in a day. We would push the rock up the hill, only to have it tumble down again. But conditions did improve. We had won a host of small battles that added up to a change in the atmosphere of the island. While we did not run the island, the authorities could not run it without us, and in the aftermath of Van Rensburgs departure, our life became more tolerable.    Within our first three years on the island we were all given long trousers. By 1969, we received our own individual prison uniforms, instead of being issued a different set each week. These uniforms actually fit us and we were allowed to wash them ourselves. We were permitted out in the courtyard at all hours during the weekend. Although our food was not yet equalized, African prisoners would occasionally receive bread in the morning. We were allowed to pool our food anyway, so that the differences did not matter. We had been given board games and cards, which we often played on Saturdays and Sundays. At the quarry, our talk was rarely interrupted. If the commanding officer was coming, the warders on duty would blow a whistle to warn us to pick up our tools. We had neutralized the worst warders and befriended the more reasonable ones, though the authorities realized this and rotated warders every few months.    We were able to meet among ourselves virtually whenever we wanted. Meetings of the High Organ, general members meetings, and meetings of Ulundi were generally not broken up unless they were too conspicuous. The inmates seemed to be running the prison, not the authorities.   Stern and God-fearing, the Afrikaner takes his religion seriously. The one inflexible event on our weekly schedule was Sunday morning religious services. This was an observance the

DETAILED ANSWER:

RESPONSE:

I think about my son a lot. I think about the day he came to visit me at the safe house and how he was wearing my old jacket. It's hard to lose a child. I was not able to attend his funeral and that was really tough. I was only able to write a letter to his mother. The conditions in prison improved over time, but it was a slow process. We won some small battles that made life more tolerable. We were given our own uniforms and allowed to wash them ourselves. We were also allowed to pool our food. We were able to meet among ourselves whenever we wanted. The one inflexible event on our weekly schedule was Sunday morning religious services. This was an observance the Afrikaner takes seriously.

QUESTION: what is your perspective about unequal wage?

PASSAGE: then did we notice that the gentleman in whose house we were staying was nowhere to be found  he had slipped out and gone to work. The strike was shaping up as a failure.    We resolved to call off the strike. A three-day strike that is canceled on the first day is only a one-day failure; a strike that fails three days running is a fiasco. It was humiliating to have to retreat, but we felt that it would have been more humiliating not to. Less than one hour after we had released a statement calling off the strike, the government-run South African Broadcasting Corporation read our announcement in full. Normally, the SABC ignored the ANC altogether; only in defeat did we make their broadcasts. This time, they even complimented us on calling off the strike. This greatly annoyed Moses Kotane. To be praised by the SABC, that is too much, he said, shaking his head. Kotane questioned whether we had acted too hastily and played into the states hands. It was a legitimate concern, but decisions should not be taken out of pride or embarrassment, but out of pure strategy  and strategy here suggested we call off the strike. The fact that the enemy had exploited our surrender didnt mean we were wrong to surrender.    But some areas did not hear that the strike was called off, while others spurned our call. In Port Elizabeth, an ANC stronghold, and other areas of the Cape, the response was better on the second and third days than the first. In general, however, we could not hide the fact that the strike was a failure. As if that were not enough, the Nationalists increased their popular vote in the election by more than 10 percent.    We had heated discussions about whether we ought to have relied on coercive measures. Should we have used pickets, which generally prevent people from entering their place of work? The hard-liners suggested that if we had deployed pickets, the strike would have been a success. But I have always resisted such methods. It is best to rely on the freely given support of the people; otherwise, that support is weak and fleeting. The organization should be a haven, not a prison. However, if the majority of the organization or the people support a decision, coercion can be used in certain cases against the dissident minority in the interests of the majority. A minority, however vocal, should not be able to frustrate the will of the majority.    In my own house, I attempted to use a different sort of coercion, but without success. Ida Mthimkhulu, a Sotho-speaking woman of my own age, was then our house assistant. Ida was more a member of the family than an employee and I called her Kgaitsedi, which means Sister and is a term of endearment. Ida ran the house with military efficiency, and Winnie and I took our orders willingly; I often ran out to do errands at her command.    The day before the strike, I was driving Ida and her twelve-year-old son home, and I mentioned that I needed her to wash and press some shirts for me the following day. A long and uncharacteristic silence followed. Ida then turned to me and said with barely concealed disdain, You know very well that I cant do that.    Why not? I replied, surprised by the vehemence of her reaction.    Have you forgotten that I, too, am a worker? she said with some satisfaction. I will be on strike tomorrow with my people and fellow workers!    Her son saw my embarrassment and in his boyish way tried to ease the tension by saying that Uncle Nelson had always treated her as a sister not a worker. In irritation, she turned on her wellmeaning son and said, Boy, where were you when I was struggling for my rights in that house? If I had not fought hard against your Uncle Nelson I would not today be treated like a sister! Ida did not come to work the next day, and my shirts went unpressed.                                                                             28 FEW ISSUES touched a nerve as much as that of passes for women.

RESPONSE:

The question asks for my perspective on unequal wage, to which I answer that it is an unfortunate reality in many parts of the world. The passage provides context for this perspective by recounting Nelson Mandela's experience with a failed strike and the aftermath. He discusses the importance of strategy and how, in his opinion, coercion should only be used in certain cases and with the support of the majority. He then tells a story about his house assistant, Ida Mthimkhulu, who refused to do work for him the day of the strike. This story highlights the tension between employer and employee that can exist even in cases where there is mutual respect. In the end, Mandela concedes that unequal wage is a reality in many parts of the world and that it is an unfortunate reality.

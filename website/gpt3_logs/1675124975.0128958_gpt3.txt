PASSAGE: taking actions that were morally justified.    But the drama of the opening arguments was succeeded by the tedium of court logistics. The first month of the trial was taken up by the states submission of evidence. One by one, every paper, pamphlet, document, book, notebook, letter, magazine, and clipping that the police had accumulated in the last three years of searches was produced and numbered; twelve thousand in all. The submissions ranged from the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights to a Russian cookbook. They even submitted the two signs from the Congress of the People: SOUP WITH MEAT and SOUP WITHOUT MEAT.    During the preparatory examination, which was to last for months, we listened day after day as African and Afrikaner detectives read out their notes of ANC meetings, or transcripts of speeches. These recountings were always garbled, and often either nonsensical or downright false. Berrang later revealed in his deft cross-examination that many of the African detectives were unable to understand or write English, the language in which the speeches were given.   To support the states extraordinary allegation that we intended to replace the existing government with a Soviet-style state, the Crown relied on the evidence of Professor Andrew Murray, head of the Department of Political Science at the University of Cape Town. Murray labeled many of the documents seized from us, including the Freedom Charter itself, as communistic.    Professor Murray seemed, at the outset, relatively knowledgeable, but that was until Berrang began his cross-examination. Berrang said that he wanted to read Murray a number of passages from various documents and then have Murray label them communistic or not. Berrang read him the first passage, which concerned the need for ordinary workers to cooperate with each other and not exploit one another. Communistic, Murray said. Berrang then noted that the statement had been made by the former premier of South Africa, Dr. Malan. Berrang proceeded to read him two other statements, both of which Professor Murray described as communistic. These passages had in fact been uttered by the American presidents Abraham Lincoln and Woodrow Wilson. The highlight came when Berrang read Murray a passage that the professor unhesitatingly described as communism straight from the shoulder. Berrang then revealed that it was a statement that Professor Murray himself had written in the 1930s.    In the seventh month of the trial, the state said it would produce evidence of planned violence that occurred during the Defiance Campaign. The state called the first of their star witnesses, Solomon Ngubase, who offered sensational evidence that seemed to implicate the ANC. Ngubase was a soft-spoken fellow in his late thirties, with a shaky command of English, who was currently serving a sentence for fraud. In his opening testimony, Ngubase told the court he had obtained a bachelor of arts degree from Fort Hare, and that he was a practicing attorney. He said he became secretary of the Port Elizabeth branch of the ANC as well as a member of the National Executive Committee. He claimed to have been present at a meeting of the National Executive when a decision was made to send Walter Sisulu and David Bopape to the Soviet Union to procure arms for a violent revolution in South Africa. He said he was present at a meeting that planned the 1952 Port Elizabeth riot and that he had witnessed an ANC decision to murder all whites in the Transkei in the same manner as the Mau Mau in Kenya. Ngubases dramatic testimony caused a stir in and out of court. Here at long last was evidence of a conspiracy.    But when Ngubase was cross-examined by Vernon Berrang, it was revealed that he was equal parts madman and liar. Berrang, whose cross- examination skills earned him the nickname Isangoma (a diviner or healer who exorcises an illness) among the accused, quickly established that Ngubase was neither a university

DETAILED ANSWER: 

==========

RESPONSE:

Nelson Mandela: The state's case against us relied heavily on the testimony of Solomon Ngubase, who was later revealed to be a liar and a madman. Berrang's cross-examination of Ngubase was masterful, and exposed the state's case for what it was: a farce.

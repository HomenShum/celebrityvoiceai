PROMPT:

The passage discusses the importance of trade and manufacture from the perspective of African Nationalism. The author argues that the African National Congress (ANC) has always been focused on the goal of winning unity and full political rights for the African people, and that cooperation with the Communist Party is simply a means to this end. The author also notes that many Africans tend to equate freedom with communism, due to the fact that communists have historically been the only group who have treated Africans as equals.  The passage mentions several reasons why trade and manufacture would be important. First, the author notes that the amaMfengu are often more educated and Western than other Africans. This contact with Europeans gives them an advantage in terms of knowledge and skills. Second, the author mentions that the amaMfengu are often wealthier than their Xhosa compatriots. This economic advantage allows them to invest in better houses and other amenities. Finally, the author mentions that the amaMfengu confirm the missionaries' axiom that "to be Christian is to be civilized." This suggests that trade and manufacture are important because they are associated with Christianity and Westernization.  The government's proposals at CODESA 2 would have effectively given the National Party a veto over any changes to the constitution, as well as entrenching regional powers. This was unacceptable to the ANC, and led to the breakdown of negotiations.  The passage discusses a number of reasons why trade and manufacture would be important. First, it notes that education is a key engine of personal development. Through education, people from all backgrounds can achieve success. Second, the passage discusses how the Afrikaner government was hostile to education for Africans. The government believed that education was a waste for Africans, and sought to control African education through the Bantu Education Act. Finally, the passage notes that even this limited amount of education was distasteful to the Nationalists. The Nationalists believed that Africans were inherently ignorant and lazy, and that no amount of education could change that.  The Freedom Charter is a document that outlines the goals of the liberation struggle in South Africa. It calls for equal rights for all, regardless of race, color, or sex. It also calls for the redistribution of wealth and land ownership. Trade and manufacture are important because they are essential to the economy of South Africa. The Freedom Charter calls for the control of industries and trade in order to help the people of South Africa.

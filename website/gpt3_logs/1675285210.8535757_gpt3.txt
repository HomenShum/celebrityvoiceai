QUESTION:  why would trade and manufacture be important?

PASSAGE: conducting covert operations against the ANC. These two scandals coming together undermined the credibility of the government and strengthened our hand.    Over the previous months, the government had made numerous proposals that fell by the wayside. Most of them, like the idea of a rotating presidency, sought to preserve their power. But through negotiations over the past months, the ANC and government teams had put together a tentative agreement involving a two-stage transitional period to a fully democratic South Africa. In the first stage, a multiparty transitional executive council would be appointed from the CODESA delegations to function as a temporary government in order to level the playing field for all parties and create an interim constitution. In the second stage, general elections would be held for a constituent assembly and legislature in which all political parties winning 5 percent or more of the vote would participate in the cabinet. Half the members of the assembly would be elected on a national basis and half on a regional one, and the assembly would be empowered both to write a new constitution and to pass legislation. An independent commission would preside over the election and make sure it was free and fair.    Yet there were many matters on which the ANC and the government could not reach agreement, such as the percentage of voting necessary in the assembly to decide constitutional issues and to agree on a bill of rights. Only days before CODESA 2, the government proposed a second body, a senate, composed of regional representatives, as a way of ensuring a minority veto. They also proposed that before all this, CODESA 2 first agree on an interim constitution, which would take months to draw up.    All of this bargaining was going on behind the scenes and by the time CODESA 2 opened on May 15, 1992, prospects for agreement looked bleak. What we disagreed about was threatening all that we had agreed upon. Mr. de Klerk and I had not managed to find a consensus on most of the outstanding issues. The government seemed prepared to wait indefinitely; their thinking was that the longer we waited, the more support we would lose.    The convention was deadlocked at the end of the first day. At that time, the two judges presiding over the talks told Mr. de Klerk and me to meet that evening to attempt to find a compromise. We did meet that night over coffee, and though we did not find a way out of the impasse, we agreed that the negotiations must not founder. The whole of South Africa and the world is looking at you and me, I told Mr. de Klerk. Let us save the peace process. Let us reach some kind of agreement. Let us at least fix a date for the next round of talks. We decided that we would each speak the following day in a spirit of constructive compromise.    The next afternoon we spoke in the reverse order that we had agreed to at CODESA 1: Mr. de Klerk first and I last. In his remarks, Mr. de Klerk insisted that the National Party did not seek a minority veto, but that he did want a system of checks and balances so that the majority would not be able to misuse its power. Although this certainly sounded to me like outright opposition to the idea of majority rule, when I spoke after Mr. de Klerk, I merely said we needed to work in a constructive manner and dispel the tensions around the negotiations.    Despite our attempts to put a positive face on the matter, the convention ended the second day in a stalemate. The impasse, as I saw it, was caused by the National Partys continuing reluctance to submit their fate to the will of the majority. They simply could not cross that hurdle.    Ultimately, CODESA 2 broke down on four fundamental issues: the governments insistence on an unacceptably high percentage of votes in the assembly to approve the constitution (essentially a backdoor veto); entrenched regional powers that would be binding on a future constitution; an undemocratic and unelected senate

DETAILED ANSWER: 

==========

RESPONSE:

The government's proposals at CODESA 2 would have effectively given the National Party a veto over any changes to the constitution, as well as entrenching regional powers. This was unacceptable to the ANC, and led to the breakdown of negotiations.

PROMPT:

Nelson Mandela believes that the most important focus for society today should be on achieving equality for all people, regardless of race, color, or sex. He also believes that the government should be based on the will of the people, and that all people should have the same rights and opportunities.  It is clear from the passage that Nelson Mandela believes that the Defiance Campaign was a success in many ways, but that it also had its limitations. One of the main limitations was that it did not manage to reach beyond the initial stage of small batches of mostly urban defiers. Mass defiance, especially in the rural areas, was never achieved. The eastern Cape was the only region where they succeeded in reaching the second stage and where a strong resistance movement emerged in the countryside. In general, they did not penetrate the countryside, which was an historical weakness of the ANC. The campaign was also hampered by the fact that they did not have any full-time organizers. Mandela himself was attempting to organize the campaign and practice as a lawyer at the same time, which he acknowledges was not an effective way to wage a mass campaign. Despite these limitations, Mandela still feels a great sense of accomplishment and satisfaction from the campaign. It freed him from any lingering sense of doubt or inferiority he might still have felt; it liberated him from the feeling of being overwhelmed by the power and seeming invincibility of the white man and his institutions. He came to feel more confident and dignified as a result of his involvement in the campaign, and he believes that it was a just cause worth fighting for.  The Congress of the People was created in order to establish a set of principles for a new South Africa. Leaders within the ANC were authorized to seek input from the public in order to create a document, known as the charter, which would outline the goals of the new society. The Congress of the People represented one faction within the ANC which believed that it was inevitable the organization would be banned by the government and that they must be prepared to operate illegally. However, they did not want to give up on the important policies and activities that the ANC was known for. The goal of the Congress of the People was to unify all of the oppressed and progressive forces within South Africa in order to create change. To do this, they attracted sponsorship from a wide variety of organizations and invited representatives to a planning conference. The National Action Council created at this conference was composed of eight members from each of the four sponsoring organizations. The chairman was Chief Luthuli, and the secretariat consisted of Walter Sisulu (later replaced by Oliver after Walters banning forced him to resign), Yusuf Cachalia of the SAIC, Stanley Lollan of the South African Coloured Peoples Organization (SACPO), and Lionel Bernstein of the Congress of Democrats (COD). The Congress of the People sought to attract as much support as possible and put forth the idea that everyone's voice should be heard. They sent out circulars to townships and villages across the country asking for suggestions for the freedom charter. The call caught the imagination of the people and suggestions came pouring in.  Nelson Mandela believes that the focus should be on national liberation movements and the Soviet Union in particular. He believes that this will help to speed up the erasure of human prejudice and the end of chauvinistic and violent nationalism.  Nelson Mandela believes that we should focus on liberating both the oppressed and the oppressor. He says that we have merely achieved the freedom to be free, and that there is still more work to be done in order to truly achieve freedom for all.
